7	Manhattan Project. The Manhattan Project was a research and development undertaking during World War II that produced the first nuclear weapons. It was led by the United States with the support of the United Kingdom and Canada. From 1942 to 1946, the project was under the direction of Major General Leslie Groves of the U.S. Army Corps of Engineers.

12	Tutorial: Introduction to Restorative Justice. Restorative justice is a theory of justice that emphasizes repairing the harm caused by criminal behaviour. It is best accomplished through cooperative processes that include all stakeholders. This can lead to transformation of people, relationships and communities. Practices and programs reflecting restorative purposes will respond to crime by: 1  identifying and taking steps to repair harm, 2  involving all stakeholders, and. 3  transforming the traditional relationship between communities and their governments in responding to crime.
13	Organize volunteer community panels, boards, or committees that meet with the offender to discuss the incident and offender obligation to repair the harm to victims and community members. Facilitate the process of apologies to victims and communities. Invite local victim advocates to provide ongoing victim-awareness training for probation staff.
14	The purpose of this paper is to point out a number of unresolved issues in the criminal justice system, present the underlying principles of restorative justice, and then to review the growing amount of empirical data on victim-offender mediation.
15	Each of these types of communitiesâthe geographic community of the victim, offender, or crime; the community of care; and civil societyâmay be injured by crime in different ways and degrees, but all will be affected in common ways as well: The sense of safety and confidence of their members is threatened, order within the community is threatened, and (depending on the kind of crime) common values of the community are challenged and perhaps eroded.
16	The approach is based on a theory of justice that considers crime and wrongdoing to be an offense against an individual or community, rather than the State. Restorative justice that fosters dialogue between victim and offender has shown the highest rates of victim satisfaction and offender accountability.
17	Inherent in many peopleâs understanding of the notion of ADR is the existence of a dispute between identifiable parties. Criminal justice, however, is not usually conceptualised as a dispute between victim and offender, but is instead seen as a matter concerning the relationship between the offender and the state. This raises a complex question as to whether a criminal offence can properly be described as a âdisputeâ.

19	The circle includes a wide range of participants including not only the offender and the victim but also friends and families, community members, and justice system representatives. The primary distinction between conferencing and circles is that circles do not focus exclusively on the offense and do not limit their solutions to repairing the harm between the victim and the offender.

21	Phloem and xylem are complex tissues that perform transportation of food and water in a plant. They are the vascular tissues of the plant and together form vascular bundles. They work together as a unit to bring about effective transportation of food, nutrients, minerals and water.

23	Phloem is a conductive (or vascular) tissue found in plants. Phloem carries the products of photosynthesis (sucrose and glucose) from the leaves to other parts of the plant.
24	Unlike xylem (which is composed primarily of dead cells), the phloem is composed of still-living cells that transport sap. The sap is a water-based solution, but rich in sugars made by the photosynthetic areas.
25	In xylem vessels water travels by bulk flow rather than cell diffusion. In phloem, concentration of organic substance inside a phloem cell (e.g., leaf) creates a diffusion gradient by which water flows into cells and phloem sap moves from source of organic substance to sugar sinks by turgor pressure.
26	The mechanism by which sugars are transported through the phloem, from sources to sinks, is called pressure flow. At the sources (usually the leaves), sugar molecules are moved into the sieve elements (phloem cells) through active transport.
27	Phloem carries the products of photosynthesis (sucrose and glucose) from the leaves to other parts of the plant. â¦ The corresponding system that circulates water and minerals from the roots is called the xylem.
28	Xylem transports water and soluble mineral nutrients from roots to various parts of the plant. It is responsible for replacing water lost through transpiration and photosynthesis. Phloem translocates sugars made by photosynthetic areas of plants to storage organs like roots, tubers or bulbs.
29	At this time the Industrial Workers of the World had a membership of over 100,000 members. In 1913 William Haywood replaced Vincent Saint John as secretary-treasurer of the Industrial Workers of the World. By this time, the IWW had 100,000 members.
30	This was not true of the Industrial Workers of the World and as a result many of its members were first and second generation immigrants. Several immigrants such as Mary 'Mother' Jones, Hubert Harrison, Carlo Tresca, Arturo Giovannitti and Joe Haaglund Hill became leaders of the organization.
31	Chinese Immigration and the Chinese Exclusion Acts. In the 1850s, Chinese workers migrated to the United States, first to work in the gold mines, but also to take agricultural jobs, and factory work, especially in the garment industry.
32	The Rise of Industrial America, 1877-1900. When in 1873 Mark Twain and Charles Dudley Warner entitled their co-authored novel The Gilded Age, they gave the late nineteenth century its popular name. The term reflected the combination of outward wealth and dazzle with inner corruption and poverty.
33	American objections to Chinese immigration took many forms, and generally stemmed from economic and cultural tensions, as well as ethnic discrimination. Most Chinese laborers who came to the United States did so in order to send money back to China to support their families there.
34	The rise of industrial America, the dominance of wage labor, and the growth of cities represented perhaps the greatest changes of the period. Few Americans at the end of the Civil War had anticipated the rapid rise of American industry.
35	The resulting Angell Treaty permitted the United States to restrict, but not completely prohibit, Chinese immigration. In 1882, Congress passed the Chinese Exclusion Act, which, per the terms of the Angell Treaty, suspended the immigration of Chinese laborers (skilled or unskilled) for a period of 10 years.
36	Industrial Workers of the World. In 1905 representatives of 43 groups who opposed the policies of American Federation of Labour, formed the radical labour organisation, the Industrial Workers of the World (IWW). The IWW's goal was to promote worker solidarity in the revolutionary struggle to overthrow the employing class.
37	The railroads powered the industrial economy. They consumed the majority of iron and steel produced in the United States before 1890. As late as 1882, steel rails accounted for 90 percent of the steel production in the United States. They were the nationâs largest consumer of lumber and a major consumer of coal.
38	This finally resulted in legislation that aimed to limit future immigration of Chinese workers to the United States, and threatened to sour diplomatic relations between the United States and China.

49	Colorâurine can be a variety of colors, most often shades of yellow, from very pale or colorless to very dark or amber. Unusual or abnormal urine colors can be the result of a disease process, several medications (e.g., multivitamins can turn urine bright yellow), or the result of eating certain foods.
50	I had 3 cups of coffee and a red bull today all in 4 hours. The first time I urinated, it was an amber color. Then I got worried and drank a lot of water and now my urine is back to normal (light yellow). This only happened once after drinking all that caffeine.

51	During the visual examination of the urine, the laboratorian observes the urine's color and clarity. These can be signs of what substances may be present in the urine. They are interpreted in conjunction with results obtained during the chemical and microscopic examinations to confirm what substances are present.
52	But the basic details of your urine -- color, smell, and how often you go -- can give you a hint about whatâs going on inside your body. Pee is your bodyâs liquid waste, mainly made of water, salt, and chemicals called urea and uric acid. Your kidneys make it when they filter toxins and other bad stuff from your blood.
53	However, red-colored urine can also occur when blood is present in the urine and can be an indicator of disease or damage to some part of the urinary system. Another example is yellow-brown or greenish-brown urine that may be a sign of bilirubin in the urine (see The Chemical Examination section).
54	The shade, light or dark, also changes. If it has no color at all, that may be because youâve been drinking a lot of water or taking a drug called a diuretic, which helps your body get rid of fluid. Very dark honey- or brown-colored urine could be a sign that youâre dehydrated and need to get more fluids right away.
55	A good rule of thumb is the darker your urine, the more water you need to drink. And if your urine is any other color besides a various shade of yellow (which weâll get into down below) something may be wrong.
56	Color, density, and smell can reveal health problems. Human urine has been a useful tool of diagnosis since the earliest days of medicine.

69	However, a major motive with people today wanting to use the barley harvest to determine the start of the year is to justify starting the year AS EARLY AS POSSIBLE, frequently even before the end of winter. That is in fact the opposite of what the Talmud records the leaders of the Sanhedrin occasionally doing ...
70	Some people claim that the timing of the barley harvest in Israel should be the deciding factor as to when to start the new year for determining the observance of God's annual Feasts and Holy Days.
71	Barley (Hordeum vulgare L.), a member of the grass family, is a major cereal grain. It was one of the first cultivated grains and is now grown widely. Barley grain is a staple in Tibetan cuisine and was eaten widely by peasants in Medieval Europe. Barley has also been used as animal fodder, as a source of fermentable material for beer and certain distilled beverages, and as a component of various health foods.
72	The state of the barley harvest could PERHAPS cause the start of a year to be postponed to THE FOLLOWING NEW MOON (thereby giving the previous year a 13th month), but the state of the barley harvest could NEVER DETERMINE THAT AN EARLIER NEW MOON SHOULD BE USED TO START THE YEAR!
73	The grape harvest was usually completed before Tabernacles, but most of the olive harvest came after the autumn festivals. In ancient Israel the primary harvest season extended from April to November. This harvest period might be subdivided into three seasons and three major crops: the spring grain harvest, the summer grape harvest and the autumn olive harvest.
74	Barley is not as cold tolerant as the winter wheats (Triticum aestivum), fall rye (Secale cereale) or winter triticale (Ã Triticosecale Wittm. ex A. Camus.), but may be sown as a winter crop in warmer areas of Australia and Great Britain. Barley has a short growing season and is also relatively drought tolerant.
75	âWheat ripens later than barley and, according to the Gezer Manual, was harvested during the sixth agricultural season, yrh qsr wkl (end of April to end of May)â (page 88; also see the chart on page 37 of Borowskiâs book, reproduced below).
76	That claim is obviously not correct. God did not hinge the start of a new year on the state of the barley crop, even if on occasions in the first and second centuries A.D. the pharisaical leaders of the Sanhedrin in Jerusalem decided to use the state of the barley harvest to start a new year one new moon later.
77	Barley is always sown in the autumn, after the early rains, and the barley harvest, which for any given locality precedes the wheat harvest (Exodus 9:31 f), begins near Jericho in April--or even March--but in the hill country of Palestine is not concluded until the end of May or beginning of June.
78	Pentecost, near the end of the grain harvest, included grain and loaf offerings (verses 16-17). Pentecost was also called âthe Feast of Harvestâ (Exodus 23:16). Barley and wheat were planted in the autumn and ripened in spring. Barley matured faster and would be harvested sooner. The firstfruits of grain offered during the Festival of Unleavened Bread would have been barley.
79	There are however some very serious illnesses that can cause this pain in left side under ribs. These would include pneumothorax, pancreatitis, and dissection of the abdominal aorta. It could also be a spleen disorder, kidney stones, or pericardritis (inflammation of the heart sac).
80	Pancreatitis is an inflammation of the pancreas and can be caused by eating very fatty foods. If the left side pain under ribs is caused by a dissection of the abdominal aorta, your life is in immediate danger. Dying from an internal hemorrhage is the major risk involved in this situation.
81	What organs are on your left side of body. Causes of Pain under Left Rib Cage. Here are just some of the possible reasons why you may be feeling pain under your left rib cage: Gas Stuck in the Colon â There is a chance that you have gas stuck in your colon. The amount of gas that is stuck may be excessive.
82	For the individual bones, see Rib. For ribs of animals as food, see Ribs (food). For other uses, see Rib (disambiguation). The rib cage is an arrangement of bones in the thorax of all vertebrates except the lamprey and the frog. It is formed by the vertebral column, ribs, and sternum and encloses the heart and lungs.
83	If the lower set of ribs on the right side of the rib cage get damaged due to an injury, then one is likely to experience a sharp pain under the right rib cage. If the pain worsens when one tries to bend or twist the body, then an X-ray examination should be conducted to study the extent of damage to the ribs.
84	Vital organs such as heart and lungs are protected by the rib cage. Under the rib cage lie many organs that form a part of the abdomen. Most of the organs that lie in the abdominal region are a part of the digestive system. These include the liver, gallbladder, kidneys, pancreas, spleen, stomach, small intestine and the large intestine.
85	The only organs contained in the chest cavity are the lungs and the heart. Obviously, one of the lungs is under the left rib cage, and then the heart is also found here. The oâ¦nly other part of the chest cavity to be noted would be the diaphragm, which aids a person's breathing. 4 people found this useful.
86	Usually, you can feel the pain reverberating from the upper portion of the left side of your abdomen towards the left side of your ribcage. Irritation on the Spleen â There is a chance that your spleen has already ruptured because of various reasons and this can cause some pains on the left rib cage.
87	Each rib consists of a head, neck, and a shaft, and they are numbered from top to bottom. The head of rib is the end part closest to the spine with which it articulates. It is marked by a kidney-shaped articular surface which is divided by a horizontal crest into two facets.
88	With either of these there is a fairly simple medication treatment. There is also the possibility that gas is caught in the colon. This is even less serious that acid reflux and does not require medication to resolve it. Sharp pain left side under ribs might come from a condition called costochondritis.

133	An RAPD is a defect in the direct response. It is due to damage in optic nerve or severe retinal disease. It is important to be able to differentiate whether a patient is complaining of decreased vision from an ocular problem such as cataract or from a defect of the optic nerve.
134	abnormal pupillary reflex means. If this doesn't happen, it could mean that either the retina or optic nerve is damaged, or the visceromotor output pathway from the oculomotor nerve is not working. This type of response indicates ipsilateral issues.
135	The physiology behind a normal pupillary constriction is a balance between the sympathetic and parasympathetic nervous systems. Parasympathetic innervation leads to pupillary constriction. A circular muscle called the sphincter pupillae accomplishes this task. The fibers of the sphincter pupillae encompass the pupil.
136	1. These are the pupillary reflexes mediated through the parasympathetic division of the autonomic nervous system; 2. the ciliospinal reflex which tests pupillary responses mediated through the sympathetic division of the autonomic nervous system, and 3. the salivary reflex which is also parasympathetic.

149	Oral Phase. The first phase of swallowing is the oral phase which involves the tongue, mandible, lips, cheeks and palate all working together to ensure the food is adequately prepared for the future stages. In this phase, food is mixed with saliva and chewed with the aid of the muscles of mastication.
150	Swallowing is a complex act that involves the coordinated activity of the mouth, pharynx, larynx and esophagus (Figure 1). A swallow has four phases: oral preparatory, oral propulsive, pharyngeal and esophageal.3.
151	Stages of the Swallow. (Logemann, 1983, 1989,1997; Cherney, 1994) The oral preparatory phase. This part of the swallow is voluntary. It is a mechanical phase that can be by-passed by dropping liquid or food into the back of the throat. In this stage, the food is chewed into smaller pieces and tasted.
152	-purpose: to move food from the front of the oral cavity to the anterior faucial arches, where the reflexive swallow is initiated. -Less than one second in duration. -Bolus passes posteriorly in the oral cavity to the faucial pillars. -CNs V, VII, IX, X, XI and XII.
153	Article Sections. Swallowing disorders are common, especially in the elderly, and may cause dehydration, weight loss, aspiration pneumonia and airway obstruction. These disorders may affect the oral preparatory, oral propulsive, pharyngeal and/or esophageal phases of swallowing.
154	Dysphagia, or difficulty in swallowing, is not a disease in itself but a condition that can be brought on by many different causes because swallowing is a delicate process, easily disturbed. Some causes are minor and quickly treatable; others are serious, even life-threatening.
155	The coupling of the findings of diminished tongue sensory and motor function with increasing age might contribute to the increased prevalence of dysphagia, aspiration and pneumonia seen in the elderly (12, 13). In healthy individuals, the oral phase of swallowing is generally completed in approximately 1 second (14).
156	The process of swallowing is known as deglutition. The act of swallowing can be divided into three stages for easy understanding. 1. Oral stage: This is the only voluntary stage in the act of swallowing. It consists of: Mastication of food making it into a bolus fit to be swallowed. The main muscles involved in the act of chewing are: a. Masseter.
157	(5) neuromuscular components of swallowing. 1)Lip closure to hold the bolus in the mouth anteriorly (keeps food from spilling) 2)Tension in the labial and buccal musculature to close the anterior and lateral sulci. 3)Rotary jaw (circular) motion for mastication/grinding.
158	By Dr. Jonathan Aviv. The purpose of swallowing is to safely transport food from the mouth to the stomach. A myriad of diseases and conditions affect this basic purpose. Therefore, understanding the normal swallow is one of the keys to beginning to develop a therapeutic plan for the patient with impaired deglutition.

172	âIndian moundâ is the common name for a variety of solid structures erected by some of the indigenous peoples of the United States. Most Native American tribes did not build mounds. The majority were constructed in the Lower Southeast, Ohio River Valley, Tennessee River Valley and the Mississippi River Valley. Some types of shell mounds can be found along the entire length of the United Statesâ Atlantic Coast.

219	Physical properties can be used to identify and describe. substances. Physical properties of matter include odor, color, density, solubility, boiling point. and melting point, and its physical state at room temperature. A colorless, odorless liquid that. freezes at 0Â°C and boils at 100Â°C is probably water, for example. Every substance also has. chemical properties.
220	A photon is massless, has no electric charge, and is a stable particle. A photon has two possible polarization states. In the momentum representation of the photon, which is preferred in quantum field theory, a photon is described by its wave vector, which determines its wavelength Î» and its direction of propagation.
221	THE FOUR TYPES OF EVIDENCE. There are four traditional types of evidence: real, demonstrative, documentary, and testimonial. Some rules of evidence apply to all four types and some apply only to some or one of them. First, we will cover general rules of admissibility that apply to all evidence. Then, we will cover foundational rules that relate to specific kinds of evidence. Finally, we will cover some special topics, like the form of examination, the hearsay rule, and the lay opinion rule, that frequently cause problems in the courtroom.
222	For example, the pressure of electromagnetic radiation on an object derives from the transfer of photon momentum per unit time and unit area to that object, since pressure is force per unit area and force is the change in momentum per unit time.
223	The evolution of a gas, a color change, the formation of a precipitate, and the. evolution of heat are frequently telltale signs that a chemical reaction has occurred. You will examine some substances and describe their physical properties in this lab. You. will cause changes in some of these substances. You will decide whether the changes are. physical or chemical using test and making observations. You also will demonstrate that mass is. conserved in physical and chemical changes.
224	A photon is an elementary particle, the quantum of all forms of electromagnetic radiation including light. It is the force carrier for electromagnetic force, even when static via virtual photons.
225	) There is a sequence of steps to initiate upon arriving at an incident or crime scene to __.
226	The energy of a system that emits a photon is decreased by the energy E {\displaystyle E} of the photon as measured in the rest frame of the emitting system, which may result in a reduction in mass in the amount E / c 2 {\displaystyle {E}/{c^{2}}} .
227	Our task would be impossible but for two important facts. First, all of you have studied the law of evidence before, either in a course on evidence or in preparation for the bar exam. Accordingly, most of the rules presented will already be familiar to you.
228	In physics, a photon is usually denoted by the symbol Î³ (the Greek letter gamma). This symbol for the photon probably derives from gamma rays, which were discovered in 1900 by Paul Villard, named by Ernest Rutherford in 1903, and shown to be a form of electromagnetic radiation in 1914 by Rutherford and Edward Andrade.

239	John Maynard Keynes, 1st Baron Keynes, CB (5 June 1883 â 21 April 1946) was a British economist. His ideas, called Keynesian economics, had a big impact on modern economic and political theory. His ideas also had a big impact on many governments' tax and economic policies.
240	Keynes argued that governments should solve problems in the short run rather than wait for market forces to fix things over the long run, because, as he wrote, âIn the long run, we are all dead.â This does not mean that Keynesians advocate adjusting policies every few months to keep the economy at full employment.
241	Keynesian economists are rectifying that omission by integrating the real and financial sectors of the economy.â . Sarwat Jahan is an Economist and Chris Papageorgiou is a Deputy Division Chief in the IMFâs Strategy, Policy, and Review Department.
242	Keynes argued that inadequate overall demand could lead to prolonged periods of high unemployment. An economyâs output of goods and services is the sum of four components: consumption, investment, government purchases, and net exports (the difference between what a country sells to and buys from foreign countries).
243	John Maynard Keynes, 1st Baron Keynes, CB, FBA (/ËkeÉªnz/ KAYNZ; 5 June 1883 â 21 April 1946), was a British economist whose ideas fundamentally changed the theory and practice of modern macroeconomics and the economic policies of governments.
244	British economist John Maynard Keynes spearheaded a revolution in economic thinking that overturned the then-prevailing idea that free markets would automatically provide full employmentâthat is, that everyone who wanted a job would have one as long as workers were flexible in their wage demands (see box).
245	John Maynard Keynes was born at 7 Melville Road, Cambridge, England. His father was John Neville Keynes, an economics lecturer at Cambridge University. His mother was Florence Ada Brown, a successful author and a social reformer. His younger brother, Geoffrey Keynes (1887â1982) was a surgeon and bibliophile (book lover).
246	Subsequently, the term âKeynesian economicsâ was used to refer to the concept that optimal economic performance could be achieved â and economic slumps prevented â by influencing aggregate demand through activist stabilization and economic intervention policies by the government.
247	Keynesian economics gets its name, theories, and principles from British economist John Maynard Keynes (1883â1946), who is regarded as the founder of modern macroeconomics. His most famous work, The General Theory of Employment, Interest and Money, was published in 1936.
248	DEFINITION of 'Keynesian Economics'. An economic theory of total spending in the economy and its effects on output and inflation. Keynesian economics was developed by the British economist John Maynard Keynes during the 1930s in an attempt to understand the Great Depression. Keynes advocated increased government expenditures and lower taxes to stimulate demand and pull the global economy out of the Depression.

299	Using contractors and subcontractors. The difference between contractors and subcontractors. There is an important distinction between using contractors and subcontractors. Contractors. Contractors provide agreed services to a client for a set fee - and possibly duration - under a contract for services.
300	A subcontractor is a person who is hired by a general contractor (or prime contractor, or main contractor) to perform a specific task as part of the overall project and is normally paid for services provided to the project by the originating general contractor.
301	A subcontractor agreement is an agreement which specifies the terms of a relationship between a contractor and subcontractor, including the type of work the subcontractor is being hired to perform.
302	(sabkÉnËtrÓktÉ) , ((American) sabËkontraktÉr) noun. a person who undertakes work for a contractor and is therefore not directly employed by the person who wants such work done. The building contractor has employed several subcontractors to build the block of flats.
303	With this approach, each subcontractor is assigned an expected claim level or claim experience target based on its loss history, for claim categories that have a credible volume of information for actuarial projections.
304	Subcontractors are frequently hired to work on construction sites. A subcontractor agreement specifies the terms of a relationship between a contractor and subcontractor, including the type of work the subcontractor is being hired to perform. Electricians may work as subcontractors on a construction project.
305	There is an important distinction between using contractors and subcontractors. Contractors provide agreed services to a client for a set fee - and possibly duration - under a contract for services. (This is in contrast to a contract of service, eg a contract of employment, which is between an employee and employer.)
306	For the class of mathematical functions, see Subcontraction map. A subcontractor is an individual or in many cases a business that signs a contract to perform part or all of the obligations of another's contract.
307	A subcontractor has a contract with the contractor for the services provided - an employee of the contractor cannot also be a subcontractor. Subcontractors undertake work that a contractor cannot do but for which the contractor is responsible.

330	the dust bowl was caused partially by the great depression, due to the depression, farmers were trying to make maximum profit, so they cut down trees to get more land, planted too much, and let cattle graze too much, and that took out all the roots holding the soil together, causing the soil to loosen into dust and blow everywhere.

349	Water going from a gas to a liquid: Condensation. Water going from a gas to a solid: Deposition. In each phase change there will be either an absorption or release of latent heat. Latent heat absorption cools the surrounding air while latent heat release warms the surrounding air.

352	The term sublimation refers to a physical change of state and is not used to describe transformation of a solid to a gas in a chemical reaction. For example, the dissociation on heating of solid ammonium chloride into hydrogen chloride and ammonia is not sublimation but a chemical reaction.
353	Sublimation (phase transition) Sublimation is the phase transition of a substance directly from the solid to the gas phase without passing through the intermediate liquid phase. Sublimation is an endothermic process that occurs at temperatures and pressures below a substance's triple point in its phase diagram.
354	Boiling Evaporation and Condensation. Evaporation is the change of phase from liquid to gas. Evaporation occurs only at the surface of the water and at every temperature. However, evaporation is directly proportional to the temperature, increasing in the temperature increasing in the rate of evaporation.
355	Sublimation is the change of state from solid to gas. Some of the solid matters change their states directly to the gas with the gained heat. For example, dry ice (frozen CO2) sublimate when heat is given. Inverse of this process is called deposition, in which gas matters lost heat and change their phase to solid.
356	CHANGE OF STATE. Evaporation, condensation, sublimation, freezing, and melting are changes of state. Evaporation is the changing of liquid water to invisible water vapor. Condensation is the reverse process. Sublimation is the changing of ice directly to water vapor, or water vapor to ice, bypassing the liquid state in each process. Snow or ice crystals result from the sublimation of water vapor directly to the solid state. We are all familiar with freezing and melting processes.
357	Introduce the process of condensation. If students do not know what the process of condensation is, you can tell them it is the opposite of evaporation. In evaporation, a liquid (like water) changes state to become a gas (water vapor). In condensation, a gas (like water vapor) changes state to become a liquid (water). Explain that as water molecules in the air cool and slow down, their attractions overcome their speed and they join together, forming liquid water. This is the process of condensation.
358	hai friend, from your points, melting, boiling and sublimation are the process done when heat taken in for transition of state of matter from solid to liquid, liquid to gas and solid to gas respectively, also evaporation comes in this section. Condensation and freezing are done when heat gone out. best regards.

369	The Koepka Genealogy and Family Tree Page. Welcome to the Koepka Family page at Surname Finder, a service of Genealogy Today. Our editors have compiled this checklist of genealogical resources, combining links to commercial databases along with user-contributed information and web sites for the Koepka surname.
370	Brooks Koepka (born May 3, 1990) is an American professional golfer. He is ranked inside the top-25 in the Official World Golf Ranking and chose a different route than other young Americans to get mainstay status on the PGA Tour, by starting his career on the European Challenge Tour and eventually the European Tour.
371	Last name: Born. This ancient name is of Anglo-Saxon origin, and is one of the earliest topographical surnames existing today. The derivation is from the Old English pre 7th Century burna, burne, spring, stream, which was originally used as a topographic name for someone who lived beside a stream.
372	Many things can go wrong when a record collection is indexed. If you're having diffculty finding Koepka ancestors in a particular database at one site, try finding it on another and compare the results.
373	In the North, however, the word burn is still used for a stream. Some instances of the modern surname, found as Bown(e), Burn(e), Burns, Born(e), Boorne, Burner and Bo(u)rner, may be locational in origin, from a place named from being beside a stream.
374	DNA testing for genealogy continues to improve. If you had some of your Koepka relatives tested several years ago, it may be worthwhile to have them retested. Likewise, as DNA testing companies have gathered more results and samples, you may be able to find more matches if you search again with your test results.
375	Last name: Born. Tweet. This ancient name is of Anglo-Saxon origin, and is one of the earliest topographical surnames existing today. The derivation is from the Old English pre 7th Century burna, burne, spring, stream, which was originally used as a topographic name for someone who lived beside a stream.
376	Nike athlete Brooks Koepka carved out a 1-under-par 34-35=69 in the final round of the Travelers Championship to post 10-under 270, down three into a two-way T9, four back of champion Russell Knox. The 26-year-old began the finale on 9-under (T6), six back of overnight leader Daniel Berger.
377	As additional sources for vital records, original documents, vintage photographs and surname-based DNA projects are discovered, this page is updated to offer the best list for researching Koepka ancestry.
378	Early years and amateur career[edit] Koepka was born in West Palm Beach, Florida but raised in Lake Worth, Florida. He attended Cardinal Newman High School. He played college golf at Florida State University where he won three events and was a three-time All-American. He qualified for the 2012 U.S. Open while still an amateur, but missed the cut.
379	A symphony is a large, multi-movement work for orchestra. It calls for instruments from all four sections (winds, strings, percussion, and brass) and explores a complete range of melody, harmony, rhythm, dynamics, and timbre. That seems like a basic definition, but even that already has a number of exceptions.
380	So we generally have either Fast-Slow-Fast-Fast or Fast-Fast-Slow-Fast. There are also different types of Key-schemes through the symphony. A good example of a classical key-scheme would be the 1st, 3rd and 4th movements are in the tonic key, but the 2nd movement and the trio of the 3rd movement are in the subdominant.
381	Some composers, including Dmitri Shostakovich, Sergei Rachmaninoff, and Carl Nielsen, continued to write in the traditional four-movement form, while other composers took different approaches: Jean Sibelius' Symphony No. 7, his last, is in one movement, whereas Alan Hovhaness's Symphony No. 9, Saint Vartanâoriginally op. 80, changed to op. 180âcomposed in 1949â50, is in twenty-four.
382	A symphony is divided into four movements; the first movement is usually fast, the second one is slow, the third is medium, and the fourth movement is fast. This pace is intended to keep the listener...
383	Lastly, the finale introduces a percussion group that is meant to be (and in the S.F. Symphony performances actually was) under the stage. It is the ticking clock on individual existence and it plays in a different tempo from the rest of the orchestra.
384	Sonata Form. Sonata form is used in many types of large-scale instrumental works of the late 18th century and the 19th century, including: Symphonies, which are technically Sonatas for Orchestra. Most Concertos are written in a modified 3-movement Sonata form, excluding the Minuet/Scherzo movement.
385	An orchestra (/ËÉËrkáµ»strÉ/ or US: /ËÉËrËkÉstrÉ/; Italian: ) is a large instrumental ensemble typical of classical music, which mixes instruments from different families, including bowed string instruments such as violin, viola, cello and double bass, as well as brass, woodwinds, and percussion instruments, each grouped in sections.
386	Indeed, after Schumann's last symphony, the Rhenish composed in 1850, for two decades the Lisztian symphonic poem appeared to have displaced the symphony as the leading form of large-scale instrumental music.
387	Believe it or not, there is a way to understand Beethoven's genius past the first eight notes. As you'll soon discover, a symphony is a form of classical music. Form is the arrangement of sections within a piece of music, and understanding how these sections work together can help the listener make sense of what the composer was trying to express.
388	1 Symphonic composition during the mature Classical period (roughly the late 18th to the early 19th century) was overwhelmingly dominated by Joseph Haydn, Wolfgang Amadeus Mozart, and Ludwig van Beethoven.
389	The word convict here (elegcw /elegxo) means to bring to light or expose error often with the idea of reproving or rebuking. It brings about knowledge of believing or doing something wrong, but it does not mean that the person will respond properly to that knowledge. Our usage of the English word, convict, is similar.
390	The first problem is the meaning of anothen: is it âagainâ or âfrom aboveâ? The occurrence of this same word in 3:31 with the unquestioned meaning âfrom aboveâ quickly tilts the evidence in that direction. It also has that meaning in 19:11, 23.
391	The word translated âcomfortâ by the NASU translators was parakaleo (an AAS3S). It was translated as âcomfortâ by the NASU (and NASB), KJV, NKJV, YLT (Youngâs Literal Translation), and the BBE (Bible in Basic English) and âencourageâ by the NET, NIV, NLT, ESV, NJB (New Jerusalem Bible), NRSV, and the RSV.
392	In 16:9, the problematic elegxo occurs: âin every instance the verb has to do with showing someone his sin, usually as a summons to repentanceâ (Carson, John, 537). Therefore, to convict the world is shaming it and attempting to persuade it of its guiltiness, and in this way âcalling it to repentanceâ (ibid.).
393	However, Louw & Nida include Luke 8:41 under 33.315: âto ask a person to accept offered hospitality â âto invite.ââ But parakaleo does not mean invite here, but simply to urge, implore, or even beg someone to do something.
394	The Ministry of the Holy Spirit John 16:4b-15 Introduction. This morning our scripture reading and special music have all been related to Palm Sunday in celebration of the day that Jesus made His triumphal entry into Jerusalem. That certainly was a special and exciting day.
395	The word elegxo refers to ânot only exposure but shame and convictionâ (Carson, John, 207). The Evangelist continues (3:20) by saying that those who refuse the Light actually hate the Light. This is followed by a contrast with those who âpractice the truth.â
396	The previous use of this word in the FG was at 13:10. In 15:5, being âapart fromâ the vine is contextually the opposite of abiding. The idea of being apart from the vine contains slight connotations to being the opposite of repentance.
397	Those additional things that Jesus wanted to say would come through the ministry of the Holy Spirit. Here in verse 13 the Spirit is again called the Spirit of Truth, but here Jesus adds that the Spirit will guide them into all truth.
398	If so, then 1:4b is a reference to personal holiness and not positional holiness. However, contextually, positional holiness seems to be the much preferred reading. For example, while 1:4 says that His choosing leads to our holiness, 1:5 says that Him predestining us leads to our adoption â¦ a positional concept.

409	Sherman Poppen attached two skis together in Muskegon, Mich., in 1965. His wife christened it the Snurfer and the kids loved it. He may have been inspired by a sled-like device made of plywood that first appeared in the 1920s. Poppen may have made the first snowboard; many say that he did. He certainly took a step in the evolution of snowboards.

412	He added bindings to keep their boots secure. (Randy Lee October 14, 2014) The Snurfer was believed to be fairly simple and had no bindings, but this is debatable. It is widely accepted that Jake Burton Carpenter (founder of Burton Snowboards) and/or Tom Sims (founder of Sims Snowboards) invented modern snowboarding. In 1981, a couple of Winterstick team riders went to France at the invitation of Alain Gaimard, marketing director at Les Arcs.
413	Who Invented Snowboarding? Tom Sims invented snowboarding when he built the first snowboard in 1963. Growing up in New Jersey, the young surfer and skateboarder became frustrated when ice and snow prevented him from pursuing his passion for board sports during the winter months.
414	Digital Vision/Digital Vision/Getty Images. Tom Sims invented snowboarding when he built the first snowboard in 1963. Growing up in New Jersey, the young surfer and skateboarder became frustrated when ice and snow prevented him from pursuing his passion for board sports during the winter months.
415	The next major advance came in 1982, when Sims put metal edges on his snowboard so it could be used in a wider variety of snow conditions. He went on to improve and expand the sport over the years, introducing new snowboarding styles, bindings and designs.
416	The first real ski technology for snowboards was introduced by Burton and Winterstick in 1980. Their new prototype had a P-Tex base. In 1982 the first international snowboard race was held in Suicide Six, outside of Woodstock, Vermont.
417	By 1986, although still very much a minority sport, commercial snowboards started appearing in leading French ski resorts. In 2008, selling snowboarding equipment was a $487 million industry. In 2008, average equipment ran about $540 including board, boots, and bindings.
418	Snowboards are boards that are usually the width of one's foot longways, with the ability to glide on snow. Snowboards are differentiated from monoskis by the stance of the user. In monoskiing, the user stands with feet inline with direction of travel (facing tip of monoski/downhill) (parallel to long axis of board), whereas in snowboarding, users stand with feet transverse (more or less) to the longitude of the board.
419	Hedy Lamarr: Movie star, inventor of WiFi. Hollywood is a place where folks are often recognized more for their looks than their talent - and actress Hedy Lamarr was no exception. But it's what she invented in her spare time - to help end that war - that has history turning a kinder eye, linking her to a bombshell of a whole different sort. Lee Cowan reports: She possessed the kind of beauty that was haunting - an almost smoldering sensuality, with an exotic accent to match.
420	The typical Wi-Fi setup contains one or more Access Points (APs) and one or more clients. An AP broadcasts its SSID (Service Set Identifier, Network name) via packets that are called beacons, which are broadcasted every 100ms.
421	Wi-Fi or WiFi (/ËwaÉª faÉª/) is a technology that allows electronic devices to connect to a wireless LAN (WLAN) network, mainly using the 2.4 gigahertz (12 cm) UHF and 5 gigahertz (6 cm) SHF ISM radio bands.
422	Also the firmware running on the client Wi-Fi card is of influence. Say two AP's of the same SSID are in range of the client, the firmware may decide based on signal strength (Signal-to-noise ratio) to which of the two AP's it will connect.

424	The first version of the wireless protocol's legacy is now obsolete and would be considered dreadfully slow by todayâs standards. It had a maximum data transfer rate of 2 Mbps, or Megabits per second. Most applications created today would not be able to operate efficiently at those speeds.
425	But where did it come from? In 1985, the technology called 802.11 was made available for use due to a U.S. Federal Communication Commission ruling, which released the three bands of the radio spectrum now used for nearly all wireless communication: 900 MHz, 2.4 GHz, and 5 GHz.
426	Following are a few facts about WiFi: Back in 1991 Wi-Fi was invented by NCR Corporation/AT&T (later on Lucent & Agere Systems) in Nieuwegein, the Netherlands. Initially meant for cashier systems the first wireless products were brought on the market under the name WaveLAN with speeds of 1Mbps/2Mbps. Vic Hayes who is the inventor of Wi-Fi has been named 'father of Wi-Fi' and was with his team involved in designing standards such as IEEE 802.11b, 802.11a and 802.11g.
427	When the IEEE was formed in 1990, they chose Vic Hayes, also popularly known as the Father of Wi-Fi, as its chairman. For the next ten years, Hayes helped direct the development of new wireless protocols as well as market the technology worldwide.
428	Wireless Revolution: The History of WiFi. Believe it or not, there was a time when if you wanted to get on the Internet your only option was to have a phone cable or Ethernet cable plugged directly into your computer or laptop.
429	So that's what Bezirksschornsteinfegermeister means. What was once the longest word in the German language, a tongue consisting of many ridiculously lengthy words, is no more. A regional parliament recently repealed the legislative measure, which was established in 1999, rendering the word obsolete.
430	This earns the word a Guinness World Record. It is also one of the longest monosyllabic words of the English language. 8 Euouae is six letters long, but all of the letters are vowels. It holds two Guinness World Records.
431	14 of the Longest Words in English. Yes, this article is about some of the longest English words on record. No, you will not find the very longest word in English in this article. That one word would span about fifty-seven pages. Itâs the chemical name for the titin protein found in humans. Its full name has 189,819 letters.
432	Question: What is the longest word in Spanish? Answer: The answer depends on what you mean by the longest word, but regardless of your definition the longest word isn't superextraordinarÃ­simo, the 22-letter word once listed in a famous recordbook and the word that was usually cited as the longest in the language. (It means most superextraordinary.)
433	A man has been recorded spending more than three hours to pronounce what is supposedly the longest word in the English language. 'Methionylthreonylthreonylglutaminylarginyl...isoleucine' is the chemical name of 'titin' (also known as 'connectin') - the largest known protein.
434	The 7 Longest Words In The English Language. Before we start, we thought that we should clarify a few points about our selection. Some of these words have been coined, some are scientific terms (which aren't part of everyday conversation) and some do actually appear in the dictionary.
435	The longest word in the Oxford English Dictionary is 'pneumonoultramicroscopicsilicovolcanoconiosis' at 45 letters long. 'Supercalifragilisticexpialidocious', made famous by Mary Poppins, is 34 letters long. > 'Amazeballs', 'mummy porn', 'frenemy' make Collins online dictionary.
436	The classic longest German word is DonaudampfschiffahrtsgesellschaftskapitÃ¤n, which in English becomes four words: Danube steamship company captain.. More than most other languages, German tends to string words together to form new vocabulary. All languages, including English, do this to some extent, but German takes it to new extremes.
437	What was once the longest word in the German language, a tongue consisting of many ridiculously lengthy words, is no more. The term rindfleischetikettierungsÃ¼berwachungsaufgabenÃ¼bertragungsgesetz â that's 63 letters long for those of you keeping track at home â means the law for the delegation of monitoring beef labeling..
438	Another reason why there really isn't a single longest German word: German numbers, long or short, are written as one word. For example, to say or write the number 7,254, not really a very long number, the German is siebentausendzweihundertvierundfÃ¼nfzig, a single word of 38 letters.

479	The DNA polymerases are enzymes that create DNA molecules by assembling nucleotides, the building blocks of DNA. These enzymes are essential to DNA replication and usually work in pairs to create two identical DNA strands from a single original DNA molecule.
480	DNA polymerases are responsible for adding nucleotides to the strands of new DNA being created. They are also responsible for replacing the RNA primers with DNA.
481	DNA polymerase is the enzyme that joins nucleotides together to make a new DNA strand. Other proteins separate the original DNA strands, but DNA polymerase makes new DNA.

484	The second two activities of DNA Pol I are important for replication, but DNA Polymerase III (Pol III) is the enzyme that performs the 5'-3' polymerase function.
485	DNA ligase is responsible for joining together fragments of DNA. In DNA replication, after the primers are replaced by DNA Polymerase I, DNA ligase assists in the formation ph â¦ osphodiester bonds between the fragments. This is essential for creating one continuous strand.
486	A number of proteins are associated with the replication  fork, which helps in terms of the initiation and continuation of  DNA synthesis. One protein, the DNA polymerase, creates the  new DNA by adding complementary nucleotides to the template strand.
487	The role that enzymes plays in DNA replication is that the enzyme helicase breaks hydrogen bonds between the complementary bases, and the chains separate.
488	DNA polymerase is the primary enzyme responsible for DNA  replication. Two of its major roles are: the polymerization of  dNTP's or deoxyribonucleotides, and to proofread th â¦ e new copies.

739	Answer by Thibaut Descartes. Gavrilo Princip assassinated the Archduke Franz Ferdinand in Sarejevo. Gavrilo Princip was a member of the Black Hand, a Serbian nationalist group. Gavrilo Princip assassinated the Archduke Franz Ferdinand in Sarejevo. Gavrilo Princip was a member of the Black Hand, a Serbian nationalist group.
740	On 28 June 1914, Archduke Franz Ferdinand of Austria, heir to the Austro-Hungarian throne, and his wife, Sophie, Duchess of Hohenberg, were shot dead in Sarajevo, by Gavrilo Princip, one of a group of six Bosnian Serb assassins coordinated by Danilo IliÄ.
741	REUTERS/JU Muzej Sarajevo (JU Sarajevo Museum)/Handout via Reuters. One hundred years ago today in Sarajevo, a Serb nationalist shot to death at point-blank range the Archduke Franz Ferdinand, heir to the throne of the Austro-Hungarian Empire, and his wife Sophie.
742	Best Answer: Though Gavrilo Princip killed Franz Ferdinand, he was just a pawn in a huge assasination plan by the Black Hand, a Serbian freedom fighter group, who hoped to eliminate the Archduke due to the fact that the Archduke planned to give concessions to the South Slavs, therefore making a unified Greater Serbia more difficult to obtain.
743	Gavrilo Princip, an assassin affiliated with the Serbian Black Hand terrorist organization killed Archduke Franz Ferdinand.
744	On the eve of the centennial, Bosnian Serbs unveiled a statue to Gavrilo Princip, the archduke's killer, who is considered a Serbian hero and freedom-fighter.
745	Indeed, in Europe and across the pond in the United States, many learning of the archduke's death were less concerned with the drumbeats of war than the question of Austrian succession. The Washington Post, for example, published this largely fluffy piece on the royal who became the heir presumptive:
746	The Shifting Legacy Of The Man Who Shot Franz Ferdinand. The Shifting Legacy Of The Man Who Shot Franz Ferdinand. Nineteen-year-old Bosnian Serb Gavrilo Princip fired the shots that killed the heir to the Austro-Hungarian empire, Archduke Franz Ferdinand, and his wife, Sophie, during a visit to Sarajevo on June 28, 1914. Depending on whom you ask, he's either a hero or a terrorist.
747	The Archduke was killed by a group called the Black Hand by a man called Gavrilo Princip, due to the fact that the Serbians wanted freedom and independence which they didn t get, which made the Serbians want revenge, forming the terrorist group, The Black Hand and successfully killing Franz Ferdinand and his 6 month pregnant wife, Sophie.
748	This plan included 2 other conspirators,Nedjelko Cabrinovic, and Trifko Grabez, though they obviously all failed in their assasination attempts. The original plan was that these 3 people would kill the Archduke while he was driving though the streets of Sarajevo on his way to visit the city hall. Nedjelko, who made the first attempt, threw a grenade at the Archduke's car, but it instead missed, rolled underneath another car in the motorcade, and exploded.

If your acetaminophen drug level test is high, it means you may be at greater risk for liver damage and need treatment. Your health care provider may repeat this test every 4 to 6 hours until you are out of danger.
751	A blood level of acetaminophen higher than 200 mcg/mL 4 hours after ingestion means there is risk for liver damage. If the test shows a level of 50 mcg/mL or greater 12 hours after you've taken the drug, there is still risk for liver damage. Overdose levels for children are based on age and weight.
752	The acetaminophen drug level is a blood test used to screen for the presence of the common pain reliever acetaminophen. (Tylenol and paracetamol are among several other names for the same medicine.). This over-the-counter (OTC) medicine is used to treat pain and reduce fever.
753	For patients using the oral liquid with dropper: 1  Shake the bottle well before each use. 2  Measure the dose with the provided dropper. 3  Remove the cap, insert the dropper and withdraw the dose prescribed by your doctor. 4  Slowly give the medicine into your child's mouth (towards the inner cheek). 5  Replace the cap back tightly.
754	15 mg to 60 mg. 360 mg. Acetaminophen. 300 mg to 1000 mg. 4000 mg. Doses may be repeated up to every 4 hours. The prescriber must determine the number of tablets per dose, and the maximum number of tablets per 24 hours, based upon the above dosage guidance. This information should be conveyed in the prescription.
755	If treatment is received within 8 hours of the overdose, however, there is a very good chance of recovery. For children who have taken acetaminophen in liquid form, a treatment decision may be made as soon as 2 hours after ingestion since the drug is absorbed more rapidly in this form. ^ Back to top.
756	The test for acetaminophen is used to measure the level of drug in the blood in order to establish a diagnosis of overdosage, to assess the risk of liver damage, and to help decide on the need for treatment. Prompt diagnosis and treatment are important for a positive outcome.
757	1 Shake the bottle well before each use. 2  Measure the dose with the provided dropper. 3  Do not use any other syringe, dropper, spoon, or dosing device when giving this medicine to your child. 4  Remove the cap, insert the dropper and withdraw the dose prescribed by your doctor.
758	It is not safe to use more than 4 grams (4,000 milligrams) of acetaminophen in one day (24 hours), as this may increase the risk for serious liver problems. For TylenolÂ® Extra Strength, the maximum dose is 3,000 milligrams per 24 hours. You may take this medicine with or without food.

801	Select a Time Period: The Roman Empire began to slowly decline in the 3rd century AD, one of the main causes of Rome's early decline was a series of plagues, most notably the Plague of Cyprian, which decimated the population of the Empire, making it harder for Roman Emperors to levy armies and raise taxes.
802	Even if the Romans of Rome still held the title to the Empire and affected superiority over the barbarians managing their domain, Roman possession of the lands around the Mediterranean Sea was, for the most part, only on paper.
803	The Roman Empire was among the most powerful economic, cultural, political and military forces in the world of its time. It was one of the largest empires in world history. At its height under Trajan, it covered 5 million square kilometres, a territory composed of 48 nations in the 21st century.
804	I. Introduction: Rome Before the Fall [click here for a brief overview of Roman history] After nearly half a millennium of rule, the Romans finally lost their grip on Europe in the fifth century (the 400's CE).
805	The imperial successor to the republic lasted approximately 1,500 years. The first two centuries of the empire's existence were a period of unprecedented political stability and prosperity known as the Pax Romana, or Roman Peace. Following Octavian's victory, the size of the empire was dramatically increased.
806	Despite the travails of their Western counterparts, the Eastern emperorsâby then, there were two Roman emperors, one in Rome and one in Constantinopleâcontinued to demand that the entire Empire pay taxes into a common treasury.
807	The city of Rome was the largest city in the world c. 100 BC â c. 400 AD, with Constantinople (New Rome) becoming the largest around 500 AD, and the Empire's populace grew to an estimated 50 to 90 million inhabitants (roughly 20% of the world's population at the time).

819	There have been many innovations in the shapes of tea bags over the years. The earliest tea bags were sack-like in shape. Later, tea bags became flat and rectangular. In the 1950s, Lipton invented the multi-dimensional Flo-Thru tea bag, which gave leaves more room to open.
820	Oolong, a Chinese name for âblack dragon,â is a light, floral tea that, like green tea, is also packed with catechins, which help to promote weight loss by boosting your bodyâs ability to metabolise lipids (fat).
821	One part of the documentary covered Lipton tea and how it's made from many blends of tea. Up to 40 different kinds of black tea. So your lipton tea is basically a blend to get that lipton taste, so you never know where it's from or what kind of black tea it is. A tea taster would sip different teas and give them a number, then they would blend them according to these numbers to get that familiar taste.
822	I've been drinking Lipton Diet Green Tea Citrus for several years. I purchased a 12 pack of bottles at Walmart on Oct 7th of this year. The first bottle I only drank half of because it hardly had any taste and no sweetness at all. I also noticed that it had some brown sediment in the bottom of the bottle.
823	Hey, I heard that lipton tea is the best, but I want to know which flavor is the best,. Thanks. If you're limited to Lipton, I would say go for the pyramid style bags if you can find them. The bedtime story blend is actually pretty decent. If you're limited to tea bags, my advice would be to go for a loose leaf tea and just purchase a reusable tea bag to place the loose leaf tea in.
824	It will even be called a Lipton like people may say a NescafÃ© (instead of a cup of coffee). Now this is my experience from living in the Middle East (Arabian Gulf) where the majority population is migrant South Asian. I'm sure there is variety in tea habits on the actual subcontinent.
825	Tea is not as fresh as it used to be before new packaging. The tea labels disintegrate when I drop the bags in hot water. After 30 years of being a Lipton tea lover, I am ready to hunt a better tea. I always have bought the 100 single bag count regular brew.
826	After 50 years of drinking Lipton tea every day (in recent years from tea bags in the 100 box), I am abandoning this product. Life is too short to drink bad tea, and Lipton is no longer of good quality on a consistent basis. Frequently now it is just not even drinkable.

849	T/F: Air is the medium that sound waves travel through. T/F: Sound waves are a disturbance that moves through the air. T/F: Air molecules are carried along with sound waves. T/F: The speed of a wave depends on the medium through which it travels.
850	Shock Waves and Sonic Booms. The Doppler effect is observed whenever the speed of the source is moving slower than the speed of the waves. But if the source actually moves at the same speed as or faster than the wave itself can move, a different phenomenon is observed.
851	Asked by: Lockyear. Sonic boom is a common name for the loud noise that is created by the 'shock wave' produced by the air-plane that is traveling at speeds greater than that of sound ( speed of sound is approximately 332 m/s or 1195 km/hr or 717 miles/hour). These speeds are called supersonic speeds, hence this phenomena is sometimes called the supersonic boom.
852	I myself think that it is D, cause a sonic boom is caused when you break the sound barrier (speed of sound) so you need to be above the speed of sound, hope it helps 1  :) Comments (5) 2  Report.
853	Which below describes the conditions needed for a shock wave to form. An object moves at the speed of sound. The wave speed equals the objectâs speed. The wave speed equals the objectâs speed. An object moves faster than the speed of sound.
854	circle the letter that describes how increasing the speed of the wave source above the wave speed affects the shape of the bow wave that is formed. a. the bow wave is unchanged. b. the bow wave has a narrower v shape.
855	This phenomenon is known as a shock wave. Shock waves are also produced if the aircraft moves faster than the speed of sound. If a moving source of sound moves faster than sound, the source will always be ahead of the waves that it produces.
856	The Doppler effect can be observed to occur with all types of waves - most notably water waves, sound waves, and light waves. The application of this phenomenon to water waves was discussed in detail in Unit 10 of The Physics Classroom Tutorial.
857	Which best describes when a sonic boom occurs? A. when a object travels at or above the speed of sound. B. when an object travels at the speed of sound. C.When an object travels below the speed of sound. D. When an object travels above the speed of sound.
858	suppose a friend far away taps a metal fence. a. the sound is softer and travels slower through the metal than through air. b.the sound is louder and travels slower through the metal than through air. c. the sound is softer and travels faster through the metal than through air. d. the sound is louder and travels faster through the metal than through air.

1036	I also got a Buff Orpington hen from someone else, I was told she was hatched in Feb/Mar 2010. The 2 ex battery hens started laying soon after I got them and still are laying but my Buff Orpington still hav'nt started laying.
1037	Itâs understandable that a first-time chicken-keeper may be anxious to know when they can reasonably expect to see the first egg in the nest box from their new flock. Here are general guidelines for what to watch for and how to help prepare a chicken to lay her first egg.
1038	Different breeds have different amounts or shades of the pigment which accounts for Buff Orpingtons laying pale brown eggs, while Marans lay dark chocolate brown eggs. While the egg color is determined by breed and genetics within the breed, there are a few things you can do to ensure the darkest egg color.
1039	At maturity they weigh around 6 pounds and should start laying large brown eggs at approximately 24 weeks. These pullets are not debeaked for better foraging and they free range on our farm. We also feed them healthy rations of all natural chicken feeds. All have been fully vaccinated.
1040	See all reviews. Our first chickenOrdered a started Buff Orpington pullet. She arrived in great condition and has been living in her new home for 2 weeks. She laid an egg on the first day she arrived. She is a nice bird, docile and good with the children who are responsible for her care.
1041	linda07965 Junior Member. My 11/12 month old buff orpington has finely layed her first egg, she must of known I posted a message on here last week lol. I went to the nest box 2 days ago and there was a cream/slight pinky small egg in there which is a complete different colour egg to what my 2 ex-battery hens lay.
1042	One bantam was six months, the other was seven months, and the large fowl were both eight months old before laying. My 11/12 month old buff orpington has finely layed her first egg, she must of known I posted a message on here last week lol. I went to the nest box 2 days ago and there was a cream/slight pinky small egg in there which is a complete different colour egg to what my 2 ex-battery hens lay.
1043	battery hens are bred to lay, and thats what they do non stop. orpingtons are dual purpose birds, so wont lay as many eggs and the larger breeds tend to start a bit later. 12 months is a bit late but weve had really bad , cold weather so that could delay her.
1044	No matter what the breed or what color the egg ultimately ends up being, all eggshells are white when they start their journey down the oviduct. This journey takes about 26 hours, the shell taking roughly 20 hours to be completed. In the last 4-6 hours of the laying process brown eggs 'turn' brown. A hen spending too much time in the sunlight can actually have a bleaching effect on the color egg that a hen lays, as can not having access to cool water.
1045	They are so named because they can lay a variety of shades of green (mint, pale, bright, olive), pinkish or cream eggs. A particular chicken will only lay one color egg her entire life, but each EE could lay a different color egg for you. Truly a mystery until she lays her first egg.
1046	Option Pending-known as OP status means the contract is in an option period, this typically stays 7-14 days and also buyer needs to pay the option fee as well. In this case, the seller has no right to terminate the contract during this period, just only the buyer. about 3 years ago. 0 1.
1047	It is the responsibility of the listing agent to bring offers made on the home to the bank or mortgage company for their approval or rejection. All short sales are pending the mortgage companies approval. The listing agent is just announcing in the listing that itâs a short sale listing. If you make an offer for the property it may take weeks before you get confirmation that your offer has been accepted and your deposit will be tied up until you have confirmation.
1048	What does Pending Listing for Sale mean. We have an earnest money contract signed by both parties and credit pre-approved but today the language on Har changed from Pending to Pending listing for sale. I know the house was appraised 2 days ago but now concerned.
1049	Listings with the status âpending releaseâ (status 2) or âpending continue to showâ (status 3) that state âno more offersâ or âno more showingsâ are incorrectly classified. If the property is not available to show or not accepting offers, the status should be âpending no showâ (status 4). A list of the different statuses and their uses can be found on the MLSListings Portal and below. Active â Valid listing contract exists and no offer has been accepted. Pending with release, continue to show (PR) or (Pend w/Rls) â Accepted offer on the property, and a release, âescapeâ or âkick-outâ clause exists in a purchase contract that allows one party to withdraw under certain circumstances.
1050	âActive/Pending Short-Saleâ would mean the real estate agent has an offer that is waiting for approval from the bank AND the agent is still showing the house, hoping for better offers. All short-sale offers must be approved by the bank.
1051	On March 26, 2015, HAR implemented the following update: 3 days after the Option End Date passes, the system automatically changes the listing from the Option Pending status to the Pending status.
1052	Best Answer: It means a buyer made the seller an offer to purchase their house. The sellers accepted the buyer's offer. It is now in the 'Pending' status awaiting financing. It is off the market, pending mortgage approval. If the buyers can not qualify for a mortgage, the house will be back on the market usually in 30-60 days. Usually it is sold and you don't have a chance.
1053	OP-Option Pending means that the buyer has paid a fee for the unrestricted right to terminate the contract during the 'option period'. The buyer and seller agree on the amount of the fee and the length of time for the option period.
1054	Active/Pending = Usually that means the seller would like to get more offers. Savvy agents want back-up offers in place. If you made an offer to purchase a property and the seller agreed to the price, but already has a buyer in contract, you would be the 1st position back-up buyer.
1055	If the seller and agent will not show or accept offers on a property for a period of time the status of the listing should be changed to âtemporarily withdrawnâ (status 8). This will indicate to the cooperating brokers and their client(s) that the seller is not actively soliciting offers and showings for the property.

1130	(Note that some things in the Internet of things will be sensors, and sensor location is usually important.) The GeoWeb and Digital Earth are promising applications that become possible when things can become organized and connected by location.
1131	The consequences of this development for the world at large are staggering: 1  A typical family of four is expected to have 50 connected devices in 2022, double the number of 2017. 2  By the same year, 30 billion such devices are to expected to exist. 3  As a consequence, the Internet of Things will become a trillion industry.

1156	Right now, he has 6oz. of formula every 3 hours. A: Whatever feeding schedule gets the most food into your baby with the least amount of hassles is the right one for you and your baby. Remember, feeding your baby is a social interaction, not just delivery of food.
1157	Lastly, teeth appear around six months. So, if your baby is not happy about solids at four months, wait a month or two and try again. All his nutritional needs can be met by the infant formula (figure approximately two ounces of formula per pound of baby's weight).
1158	1- Make a bottle of formula (6 ounces). Take one ounce from bottle and add to one tablespoon of single grain rice cereal in a bowl. Use a soft ended spoon to mix and feed (let baby taste it at first).Make sure he is sitting up with you or in a chair. 2- Feed this cereal mix 1x per day at evening not close to bed. Do this for five days.
1159	Watch for any reactions. 4- After that, feed 2 tablespoons of single grain oatmeal + 1 1/2 ounces of formula once a day.

While there are many non-dairy foods that are rich in calcium, dairy is such an excellent source of calcium that it qualifies as a food group. According to the United States Department of Agriculture, you need about three servings of dairy every day. The downside of dairy is that it can be high in saturated fat.
1218	1 To increase your magnesium, eat whole grains, vegetables such as summer squash, green beans, broccoli, cucumbers, and spinach, and nuts and seeds.  Adult women under 30 need 310 milligrams a day, while women over 30 need 320 milligrams. Men need 400 milligrams before 30 and 420 milligrams after 30.
1219	1 Many dairy products, such as butter, cheese, and milk have vitamin D. Fortified cereals and fish are also good sources of this vitamin.  For adults under 70 years of age, 600 international units of vitamin D per day is sufficient. Adults over 70 should consume 800 international units.
1220	More isn't always better: Too much calcium has risks. Dietary calcium is generally safe, but more isn't necessarily better, and excessive calcium doesn't provide extra bone protection. If you take calcium supplements and eat calcium-fortified foods, you may be getting more calcium than you realize.
1221	Make sure you are getting enough magnesium in your daily diet to help absorb the calcium supplements you're taking. To increase your magnesium, eat whole grains, vegetables such as summer squash, green beans, broccoli, cucumbers, and spinach, and nuts and seeds.
1222	Calcium supplements aren't for everyone. For instance, if you have a health condition that causes excess calcium in your bloodstream (hypercalcemia), you should avoid calcium supplements. It's not definitive, but there may be a link between calcium supplements and heart disease.
1223	To calculate the amount of calcium in your diet, you need to keep track of your food using a food journal. Basically, you write down everything you eat in a day, including the serving size. Then you can calculate the amount of calcium in the foods you ate. For instance, a cup of yogurt has 415 milligrams of calcium.
1224	You can use more yogurt (and more calcium) to thicken your smoothie bowl, too. Smoothie bowls are often made with fresh berries -- not only for good nutrition but also for the gorgeous colors. Make your smoothie bowl a work or art by topping it with nuts, seeds, granola and dried or fresh fruit.
1225	Even if you eat a healthy, balanced diet, you may find it difficult to get enough calcium if you: 1  Follow a vegan diet. 2  Have lactose intolerance and limit dairy products.  Consume large amounts of protein or sodium, which can cause your body to excrete more calcium.
1226	Shredding important documents like your MSN, Explanation of Benefits (EOB), other statements, and bills will ensure that thieves cannot get their hands on this sensitive information. â¢ Reviewing your MSN is one of the best ways that you can help detect potential errors and fraud.
1227	It is important to immediately open and read your MSN to make sure that you have received all of the services listed. â¢ Use the Personal Health Care Journal, which you can obtain from your local SMP, to keep a record of medical visits, tests, receipts for services, and equipment you have received.
1228	Youâll get your MSN every 3 months if you get any services or medical supplies during that 3-month period. If you donât get any services or medical supplies during that 3-month period you wonât get an MSN for that particular 3-month period.
1229	â¢ Review your MSN and compare it to your receipts, records and Personal Health Care Journal. If you notice any mistakes, or have questions, report them immediately! Call your provider or health plan with your questions. If you still have unanswered questions, call your local SMP.
1230	Explaining the Medicare Summary Notice. When you are enrolled in Medicare, and you receive health services, the health care provider directly bills Medicare. The Medicare program pays your health care provider for her services. You then receive a Medicare Summary Notice (MSN), describing the services and cost of service. The MSN is a not a bill to you, but you should spend some time reviewing the information, nonetheless.
1231	â¢ Protecting your personal information is the first line of defense against fraud. Although you should save your Medicare Summary Notices and related statements, make sure to shred them when they are no longer useful.
1232	1 If you paid a bill before you got your notice, compare your MSN with the bill to make sure you paid the right amount for your services. 2  If an item or service is denied, call your doctorâs or other health care provider's office to make sure they submitted the correct information. 3  If not, the office may resubmit.
1233	The Medicare Summary Notice contains a summary of your benefits for Medicare, including Part A, Part B and Part C. In mid-2013, the federal government redesigned the Medicare Summary Notice. Based on the results of a study of Medicare recipients, several changes were made that make the MSN easier to read and understand.
1234	It's not a bill. Itâs a notice that people with Original Medicare get in the mail every 3 months for their Medicare Part A and Part B-covered services.
1235	Medicare Summary Notice. A notice sent to a patient by Medicare showing all the services or supplies that providers and suppliers billed to Medicare during the prior 3-month period, what Medicare paid, and what the patient owes the provider.

1279	The plan has the flexibility to increase some deployments to seven months compared with the normal six-month assignments, the Navy said this week.

1298	Speedy Gonzales, the beloved Looney Tunes mouse who can outrun the fastest of cats and whose Arriba! Arriba! Andale! Andale! cry was a Saturday morning staple for kids growing up in the 1960s, is being eyed as an animated feature at Warner Bros. with Mexicoâs own beloved filmmaker/actor Eugenio Derbez voicing the mouse. âIn Mexico we grew up watching Speedy Gonzales,â Derbez told Deadline. âHe was like a superhero to us, or maybe more like a revolutionario like Simon Bolivar or Pancho Villa.

1314	After eating, peristalsis in the ileum forces chyme into the cecum. When the cecum is distended with chyme, contractions of the ileocecal sphincter strengthen. Once chyme enters the cecum, colon movements begin. Mechanical digestion in the large intestine includes a combination of three types of movements.
1315	The ileum is the last section of the small intestine. Like the jejunum, it is also around 10 feet long and its pH lies between 7 and 8. The bacterial density here is also 10 4 -10 7 CFU/mL and has a microbe community similar to that of the colon.
1316	Second, as the discussion of physical planning indicated, it is not to be assumed that the particular patterns of factory size, task composition and subdivison. grouping of tasks into jobs, and work group arrangements involved in production are a direct consequence of the requirements of physical technology.
1317	Cloud computing has been a hugely disruptive technology in the business world, displacing many resources that would conventionally have been located in-house or provided as a traditionally hosted service.
1318	AOL: Three Decades of Turmoil. Introduction. AOL has gone from fame and glory to hype to trying everything possible simply to survive. Started in 1983 as âQuantum Computerâ (Agamawi, 2012), later renamed America Online, the company went public on the NASDAQ in 1992 and proceeded to grow 50,000% in just two yearâs time.
1319	In January 2001 AOL merged with what was widely considered a conservative media company called Time Warner, itself having been built largely through mergers and acquisitions. At the time of the merger, Time Warner was valued at $90 billion, compared to AOLâs $175 billion.
1320	The development of Western technology . One of the most fascinating problems of technological change is the rise and continuing development of Western âindustrialâ technology, and it has attracted a corresponding amount of attention.
1321	Finally, a firm×³s culture has also been identified as a critical precondition for the emergence of disruptive innovation. Firm culture refers to a core set of attitudes and practices that are shared by the members of the firm (Detert et al., 2000; Martin, 2002 ; Schultz and Hatch, 1996).
1322	Major changes in human life have been associated with major technological changes, such as the âfood-producing revolution,â the âurban revolution,â and the âindustrial revolutionâ and its modern continuations; even the evolution of biologically modern man has been influenced by innovations in tool using.
1323	Much less attention has been paid to the role of innovation processes, including their goals and design, in promoting disruptive innovation. In this paper we aim to begin to fill this gap by better understanding how new innovation processes can act as antecedents for disruptive innovation.

1325	A disruptive technology is one that displaces an established technology and shakes up the industry or a ground-breaking product that creates a completely new industry. Harvard Business School professor Clayton M. Christensen coined the term disruptive technology. In his 1997 best-selling book, The Innovator's Dilemma, Christensen separates new technology into two categories: sustaining and disruptive.
1326	There are two places where the bicep muscle connects: the shoulder and the elbow. In your shoulder, tendons connect your bicep into the shoulder joint. In your elbow, tendons keep the muscle attached to your lower arm. We most often see bicep injuries at the connection point with your shoulder. Strains or tears can develop in the ligaments.
1327	Rotator cuff. A combination of muscles and tendons keeps your arm centered in your shoulder socket. These tissues are called the rotator cuff. They cover the head of your upper arm bone and attach it to your shoulder blade. Biceps tendons. The biceps muscle is in the front of your upper arm.
1328	10 Possible Causes of Arm Pain. Featured, Your Health. Sources of arm pain are numerous, affecting the muscles, tendons, ligaments, and bones of the arm, shoulder, elbow, wrist, hand, and fingers. If youâre experiencing a strange pain, tenderness, or numbness in your arm, and you donât know why, consider the following 10 common causes of arm painâ¦.
1329	Left shoulder pain can be extremely concerning, especially when the cause is unknown. The pain may occur when you breathe deeply, making it very difficult to function throughout the day. Left shoulder pain may be the result of normal activities of daily living to serious health conditions.
1330	Years of shoulder wear and tear can cause the biceps tendon to become inflamed. Examination of the tissues in these cases commonly shows signs of degeneration. Degeneration in a tendon causes a loss of the normal arrangement of the collagen fibers that join together to form the tendon.
1331	An injury to the shoulder or surrounding region can cause pain and discomfort. Injury related left shoulder pain is usually quite obvious to a person, particularly if it manifests itself right after the accident that caused the injury. In some cases the pain may not develop immediately after an injury.
1332	Persistent pain and weakness may be a sign of a serious strain of the biceps that may also involve tearing of the attachment of the tendon inside the shoulder joint. Such serious injury may require surgery. If persistent pain and weakness is experienced the injury should be re-evaluated by a surgeon.
1333	Rotator cuff/bicep tendinosis is diagnosed by eliciting pain or weakness with stress testing of the rotator cuff muscles. There are two common tests used for diagnosis of impingement: The Neerâs Test and the Hawkinsâ Test. The Neer's test elicits pain with passive abduction of the shoulder to 180 degrees.
1334	Biceps Tendinitis. Biceps tendinitis is an inflammation or irritation of the upper biceps tendon. Also called the long head of the biceps tendon, this strong, cord-like structure connects the biceps muscle to the bones in the shoulder. Pain in the front of the shoulder and weakness are common symptoms of biceps tendinitis.
1335	Article Sections. Patients with acute brachial plexus neuritis are often misdiagnosed as having cervical radiculopathy. Acute brachial plexus neuritis is an uncommon disorder characterized by severe shoulder and upper arm pain followed by marked upper arm weakness. The temporal profile of pain preceding weakness is important in establishing a prompt diagnosis and differentiating acute brachial plexus neuritis from cervical radiculopathy.

1346	You will probably be surprised to find that your per-mile costs to fuel cars are cheaper with electric cars than with gas cars. Calculating your per-mile cost for gas cars is pretty simple, as long as you know your average cost for a gallon of gasoline, your typical fuel economy and the number of miles you drive. For example, if your car gets 25 mpg and gas is $4 per gallon, it will cost you 16 cents per mile in gasoline.
1347	About Gas Mileage Savings Calculator: Car Cost vs. Fuel Savings. You would like to save money on gas so you're considering trading in your gas guzzler for a more fuel efficient car. This calculator shows how long will it take before you pay off the balance of a vehicle purchase and really begin saving money. Based on the EPA's MPG data and assuming 45% highway driving and 55% city driving.
1348	The new label assigns each vehicle a rating from 1 (worst) to 10 (best) for fuel economy and greenhouse gas emissions (i.e., how much carbon dioxide the vehicleâs tailpipe emits each mile), as shown below. Consumers may note that higher fuel economy is associated with a better GHG emissions profile.
1349	Itâs that simple. We take the average distance that a gasoline-powered vehicle can drive on a gallon of gas (28.2 miles for comparable 2012 model year cars), and then calculate how much it would cost to drive the average EV that same distance.
1350	Fuel consumption rate. Kilowatt-hours is an energy unit for electricity. This value tells you how many kilowatt-hours the vehicle would use to travel 100 miles. Like gallons per 100 miles, this kilowatt-hours per 100 miles value relates directly to the amount of electricity used, and thus to cost.
1351	The fuel savings, in gallons, for a vehicle that gets 10 MPG versus a vehicle that gets 15 MPG is about 33 gallons (assuming 1,000 miles). On the other hand, the fuel savings in gallons - for the same five MPG fuel economy jump - for a 30 MPG versus a 35 MPG vehicle is only about five gallons.
1352	*Gas driving costs are based on current prices of $2.31/gallon and assume a 25m/gallon gas mileage. Average 2013 gas prices were $3.58/gallon (Energy Information Administration). EV driving costs are based on 35 kwh/100 miles and standard residential rates.
1353	The price of gasoline is posted at every corner gas station, but what about the cost of driving on electricity? The Department of Energyâs eGallon provides a quick and simple answer to this question and allows electric vehicle (EV) drivers to see how much they can save on fuel by using electricity instead of gasoline.
1354	Calculate the savings from trading in your gas guzzler. You would like to save money on gas so you're considering trading in your gas guzzler for a more fuel efficient car. This calculator shows how long will it take before you pay off the balance of a vehicle purchase and really begin saving money.
1355	Calculating your electricity cost is a bit more complicated. First, visit the automaker's website for the electric car to get the specifics on the projected charging times for the type of charging system you intend to use. Then, you'll need to use your electric company's kilowatt-hour rates.
1356	Morphine, sold under many trade names, is a pain medication of the opiate type. It acts directly on the central nervous system (CNS) to decrease the feeling of pain. It can be used for both acute pain and chronic pain. Morphine is also frequently used for pain from myocardial infarction and during labour.It can be administered orally, intramuscularly, subcutaneously, intravenously, into the space around the spinal cord, or rectally.orphine is a precursor in the manufacture in a large number of opioids such as dihydromorphine, hydromorphone, hydrocodone, and oxycodone as well as codeine, which itself has a large family of semi-synthetic derivatives.
1357	Morphine is part of a class of drugs called opiate (narcotic) analgesics, or opioid agonists, which block the transmission of pain signals to the brain by binding to nervous system proteins called opioid receptors.Morphine is also sometimes prescribed off label to treat pain in hospitalized children.: Morphine is a medication that is used for pain management and is in the class of medications called opioid narcotics. Opioids act by attaching to specific proteins called opioid receptors, which are found in the brain, spinal cord, and gastrointestinal tract.

1387	The term large-ion lithophile element (or LILE) is frequently used, but poorly defined in the geochemical literature. Some authors use LILE as a synonym for incompatible (or hygromagmatophile) trace elements (e.g.), whereas others use LILE to refer to a specific subset of incompatible trace elements characterized by small charge to ionic radius ratio (or low field strength elements; ). relative to more compatible trace elements. The LILE are strongly enriched in the upper continental crust (. ), but occur in lower concentrations in the deep continental crust due to its overall more mafic character and selective loss of some LILE during high-grade metamorphism (see Metamorphism).

1433	Poetic Form: Sonnet. read poems by this poet. William Shakespeare was born on April 23, 1564, in Stratford-on-Avon. The son of John Shakespeare and Mary Arden, he was probably educated at the King Edward IV Grammar School in Stratford, where he learned Latin and a little Greek and read the Roman dramatists. At eighteen, he married Anne Hathaway, a woman seven or eight years his senior. Together they raised two daughters: Susanna, who was born in 1583, and Judith (whose twin brother died in boyhood), born in 1585. Little is known about Shakespeare's activities between 1585 and 1592.
1434	He died one month later, on April 23, 1616. To the world, he left a lasting legacy in the form of 38 plays, 154 sonnets, and two narrative poems. When William Shakespeare died in his birthplace of Stratford-upon-Avon, he was recognized as one of the greatest English playwrights of his era.
1435	Therefore, unlike his fellow playwright Christopher Marlowe, he did not attend university. Rather, in 1582 at age 18, he married Anne Hathaway, a woman eight years his senior and three months pregnant. Their first child, Susanna, was born in 1583, and twins, Hamnet and Judith, came in 1585.
1436	Thousands of people every year continue to follow this tradition and visit Shakespeareâs Birthplace â and the house remains one of Stratford-upon-Avonâs busiest attractions.
1437	He drew up his will in January of 1616, which included his famous bequest to his wife of his second best bed.. He died on April 23, 1616, and was buried two days later at Stratford Church.
1438	The Life of William Shakespeare (1564â1616). Within the class system of Elizabethan England, William Shakespeare did not seem destined for greatness. He was not born into a family of nobility or significant wealth.
1439	Yet in spite of these limitations, Shakespeare is now the most performed and read playwright in the world. Born to John Shakespeare, a glovemaker and tradesman, and Mary Arden, the daughter of an affluent farmer, William Shakespeare was baptized on April 26, 1564, in Stratford-upon-Avon.
1440	The money was raised successfully and the house was in the safe hands of the Shakespeare Birthplace Trust by 1847. Today, the house has been converted into a museum and is open to the public all year round.
1441	Shakespeare's Birth. The baptismal register of the Holy Trinity parish church, in Stratford, shows the following entry for April 26, 1564: Gulielmus filius Johannes Shakespeare.
1442	Shakespeare was born in 1564 into a prosperous family in Stratford-upon-Avon, UK. Although there is no record of his birth, it is presumed that Shakespeare was born on 23 April because he was entered into the baptism register of Holy Trinity Church shortly after.

1453	It sucks in smoke   Smoke is made up of mostly solid substances dispersed in a gas. The electrostatic smoke precipitator generates static electricity, this then gives the s â¦ olid particles passing through them a negative charge.
1454	Air is drawn into the unit to capture particles. The airborne particles pass through an electrostatic field and receive an ionized charge. The charged particles move into a collector section where each alternate plate is charged with the same polarity as the particles. This drives the particles to the second set of plates of an opposite charge to attract and collect the particles. The cleaned air is then returned to the plant or building.
1455	We use DC voltages in an electrostatic precipitator (ESP) because it is necessary to induce a charge on the particulates, and then attract them to a plate by the use of an opp â¦ osite charge. An AC source would be changing constantly.
1456	Electrostatic Precipitator Facts. 1  Electrostatic Precipitators use up to 50% less energy than equivalently sized media air cleaners. 2  Unlike media air cleaners and cartridge collectors that can lose up to 50% of its airflow with a dirty filter, electrostatic precipitators see an airflow drop of less than 5% when dirty.
1457	Answer by Ftrip. Confidence votes 14. With a high voltage applied to the discharge electrodes a strong electrical field is created between the electrodes and the flue gas is ionised, plus-ions migrate to the negative electrode and minus-ions migrate to the ground electrode.
1458	Unlike media air cleaners that use replaceable filters that plug up when dirty, electrostatic precipitators contain permanent cells that can be washed, either manually or with an included automatic wash system. These permanent cells do not require added static pressure when they get dirty to pull air through them.
1459	Electrostatic Precipitators for Power Plants. Many countries around the world, including our own, depend on coal and other fossil fuels to produce electricity. A natural result from the burning of fossil fuels, particularly coal, is the emission of flyash. Ash is mineral matter present in the fuel.
1460	Electrostatic precipitators are not only used in utility applications but also other industries (for other exhaust gas particles) such as cement (dust), pulp & paper (salt cake & lime dust), petrochemicals (sulfuric acid mist), and steel (dust & fumes).
1461	These fabric filters are inherently large structures resulting in a large pressure drop, which reduces the plant efficiency. Electrostatic precipitators have collection efficiency of 99%, but do not work well for flyash with a high electrical resistivity (as commonly results from combustion of low-sulfur coal). In addition, the designer must avoid allowing unburned gas to enter the electrostatic precipitator since the gas could be ignited.
1462	Electrostatic spray painting works because when the paint particles are released from the spray gun they have a negative charge and since your item is positively charged the n â¦ egative particles are attracted to it.

1503	Wine is 85 to 90 percent water, so it freezes at about 20 F (-6.7 C) -- the water freezes first at 32 F (zero C) and then the alcohol after that [source: Wine Spectator ]. It'll be slushy for a while before it becomes solid. A word to the wise: Don't freeze wine in the bottle.
1504	1 The liquid left behind is richer in alcohol, and as a consequence, further freezing would take place at progressively lower temperatures. 2  The frozen material, while always poorer in alcohol than the (increasingly rich) liquid, becomes progressively richer in alcohol.
1505	1 Freezing in this scenario begins at a temperature significantly below 0 Â°C. 2  The first material to freeze is not the water, but a dilute solution of alcohol in water. 3  The liquid left behind is richer in alcohol, and as a consequence, further freezing would take place at progressively lower temperatures.
1506	Mendeleev, the chemist who devised the periodic table, standardized the amount of ethyl alcohol (ethanol) in vodka when he was the Director of the Russian Bureau of Standards. Russian vodka is 40% ethanol and 60% water by volume (80 proof). Vodka from other countries may range from 35% to 50% ethanol by volume.
1507	The best-known freeze-distilled beverages are applejack and ice beer. Ice wine is the result of a similar process, but in this case, the freezing happens before the fermentation, and thus it is sugar, not alcohol, that gets concentrated. For an in depth discussion of the physics and chemistry, see eutectic point.
1508	A bottle of 190-proof Everclear has a freezing point of -173.2 F (-114 C), so it would come out well-chilled but still 100 percent liquid after a day in the freezer [source: Sauce ]. Eighty-proof vodka freezes at -16.5 F (-27 C), so it'd also survive unfrozen [source: Alcoholic Science ].
1509	The freezing point depends on the spirit's proof, or alcoholic concentration, which is is double its alcohol percentage. Vodka is usually about 80 proof, or 40 percent alcohol. Wine is usually around 28 proof, and grain alcohol is 190 proof -- pretty darn close to pure alcohol [source: Real Simple ].
1510	This phenomenon is known as freezing point depression. It is possible to freeze vodka, but not in a typical home freezer. The freezing point of 80 proof vodka is -26.95Â° C or -16.51Â° F, while the temperature of most home freezers is around -17Â° C. By Anne Marie Helmenstine, Ph.D.
1511	1 The first material to freeze is not the water, but a dilute solution of alcohol in water. 2  The liquid left behind is richer in alcohol, and as a consequence, further freezing would take place at progressively lower temperatures.
1512	Why doesn't vodka freeze when you put it in the freezer? The answer to the question has to do with the chemical composition of vodka and a phenomenon known as freezing point depression.

1534	10 Most Outrageous Things Benjamin Franklin Ever Did. Some call him âThe Newton of Electricity,â and others call him âThe First American.â Whatever the nickname, we can all agree Benjamin Franklin was one of a kind. After all, he invented his own alphabet, was a chess master, and thereâs even a psychological effect bearing his name.
1535	Hereâs what is known about Franklinâs formal education: 1  Franklinâs father sent Benjamin to the Boston Latin School at age eight. This public school designed to provide education in the humanities to all boys regardless of their social class.
1536	Surprisingly, although Benjamin Franklin was an accomplished inventor, scientist, writer, philosopher, statesmen, diplomat, and abolitionist, he did not actually graduate from the finest institutions of higher learning. Benjamin Franklinâs greatest education came not from any type of formal school but instead from his own life and experience.

1543	How do I get negative credit expunged from my credit report? I have paid off some of the creditor through collection agencies but I was told that it will be at least 10 years for it to be off my credit record. I hear there are some credit repair companies out there.
1544	To make a dispute online, you must have recently ordered a copy of your credit report. You can submit a dispute with the credit bureau who provided the credit report. To dispute via mail, write a letter describing the credit report and submit copies of any proof you have. The credit bureau investigates and removes the entry if they find that is indeed an error.
1545	Don't spend your money on those credit repair companies but they are a rip off. You can't get anything off your credit unless its more than 7 yrs old or 10 if its bankruptcy. Just because you paid it off doesn't mean that you can get it taken off the credit report.

1551	Wait out the credit reporting time limit. If all else fails, your only choice is to wait for those negative items to fall off your credit report.

1553	The Senate at that time had 60 Democrats, just enough to pass Obamacare. However after the bill passed the Senate, Democrat Senator Ted Kennedy died. In his place, Massachusetts elected Republican Scott Brown.
1554	This second bill was called the Reconciliation Act of 2010. So the House passed PPACA, the Senate bill, as well as their Reconciliation Act. At this point PPACA was ready for the President to sign, but the Senate still needed to pass the Reconciliation Act from the House.
1555	It was the trickiest legislative move ever accomplished in the Congress. Hereâs my best play-by-play: Obamacare was signed into law in March 2010. If you recall, Nancy Pelosiâs Democratic majority in the House of Representatives was unable to pass their version of a healthcare law. Because all revenue bills have to originate in the House, the Senate found a bill that met those qualifications: HR3590, a military housing bill. They essentially stripped the bill of its original language and turned it into the Patient Protection and Affordable Care Act (PPACA), aka Obamacare.
1556	For Immediate Release: WASHINGTON â Legislation dubbed the Deny Americans the Right to Know, or DARK, Act passed the House of Representatives today, but the fight for a more transparent food industry is only just beginning, EWGâs Scott Faber said following the vote.
1557	This bill is an attack on statesâ ability to assure their citizens are informed.â. Pompeoâs bill â christened the âDeny Americans the Right-to-Knowâ or DARK act by critics â would prevent states from adopting GE labeling laws that have gained widespread support over the last two years.
1558	Industry groups that stand to gain the most if the DARK Act becomes law have been some of Pompeoâs biggest campaign contributors. Since 1989, agribusiness has given him nearly $170,000, and the food and beverage industry more than $81,000, according to the non-partisan Center for Responsive Politics.
1559	âItâs outrageous that some House lawmakers voted to ignore the wishes of nine out of 10 Americans,â said Scott Faber, senior vice president of government affairs for EWG. âTodayâs vote to deny Americans the right to know whatâs in their food and how itâs grown was a foregone conclusion.
1560	âWe continue to hope that thoughtful food companies that listen to their customers will work with consumer groups to craft a non-judgmental GMO disclosure to put on the back of food packaging. Americans should have the same right as citizens of 64 other countries to know whatâs in their food and how itâs grown.â.
1561	More than 300 organizations, companies and food industry and social justice leaders oppose the DARK Act in the face of massive spending and lobbying by big chemical and food companies. Poll after poll has shown that a large majority of residents of key states and across the country support mandatory GMO labeling.
1562	Connecticut, along with Maine, also passed a law requiring GE labeling. More than 30 other states are taking up legislation to require GE labeling in 2014. Pompeoâs measure would also limit the authority of the federal Food and Drug Administration to compel companies to disclose GE ingredients.
1563	Carpal Tunnel syndrome, or a laceration to the Median Nerve at the wrist, is called a low Median Nerve injury because it occurs in the lower part of the arm (near the wrist). Most of the muscles that are given function by this nerve are not affected by a low nerve injury.

Mentioned in: Carpal Tunnel Syndrome.
1566	The Median Nerve travels down the front of your arm and enters into the palm of your hand.

1568	The nerve to the subclavius muscle is a small filament that arises from the upper trunk. It descends to the subclavius muscle in front of the subclavian artery and the lower trunk of the plexus. The suprascapular nerve arises from the upper trunk formed by the union of the fifth and sixth cervical nerves.
1569	Median nerve. The median nerve is a nerve in humans and other animals in the upper limb. It is one of the five main nerves originating from the brachial plexus. The median nerve originates from the lateral and medial cords of the brachial plexus, and has contributions from ventral roots of C5-C7(lateral cord) and C8 & T1 (medial cord).
1570	The brachial plexus (plexus brachialis) is a somatic nerve plexus formed by intercommunications among the ventral rami (roots) of the lower 4 cervical nerves (C5-C8) and the first thoracic nerve (T1).
1571	The median nerve may divide into two nerve bundles in the distal forearm and appear as a bifid median nerve in the carpal tunnel. It has an incidence of ~3%. The median nerve usually divides into two or three branches after exiting the distal edge of the transverse carpal ligament that covers the carpal tunnel. These subdivide into digital nerves that supply opposing sides of the digits.

1644	The term âTheory-Theoryâ derives from Adam Morton (1980), who proposed that our everyday understanding of human psychology constitutes a kind of theory by which we try to predict and explain behavior in terms of its causation by beliefs, intentions, emotions, traits of character, and so on.

1650	One of the greatest strengths of behavioral psychology is the ability to clearly observe and measure behaviors. Weaknesses of this approach include failing to address cognitive and biological processes that influence human actions.
1651	Watson's basic premise was that conclusions about human development should be based on observation of overt behavior rather than speculation about subconscious motives or latent cognitive processes. (Shaffer, 2000). Watson's view of learning was based in part on the studies of Ivan Pavlov (1849-1936).

Energy cost can be illustrated in a similar example: a 100-watt (i.e. 0.1 kilowatt) light bulb turned on for 8 hours uses 800 Wâh or 0.8 kWâh.If the energy cost is 25 cents per kilowatt-hour, it would cost 0.1 kW Ã 8 h Ã $0.25/kWâh = $0.20.Whereas individual homes only pay for the kilowatt-hours consumed, commercial buildings and institutions also pay for peak power consumption (the greatest power recorded in a fairly short time, such as 15 minutes).he kilowatt-hour (symbolized kWâh) is a unit of energy equivalent to one kilowatt (1 kW) of power sustained for one hour. One watt is equal to 1 J/s. One kilowatt-hour is 3.6 megajoules, which is the amount of energy converted if work is done at an average rate of one thousand watts for one hour.
1684	The unit that both gas and electricity are measured in is kilowatt hours (kWh). One kWh of gas is approximately equivalent to leaving a small gas hob burner on for an hour. One kWh of electricity is the rough equivalent of running a washing machine for an hour. Standing charge-this is a fixed amount that you are charged each day, regardless of how much gas or electricity you use. 2  Unit rate-this is the price you will pay per unit (kWh) of energy, so it can fluctuate depending on how much energy you use.

The price of electricity in the UK in 2013 averages 17.2 pence per kWh according to updated analysis of CompareMySolar, following last years article.he following graph gives average rates for Low (2100 kWh per year), Medium (3300 kWh) and High (5100 kWh) electricity users that either pay by direct debit (cheaper) or standard credit (more expensive): This gives us the following average price per kWh per energy company 1  : British Gas: 16.6 pence per kWh.
1690	Calculations of these costs at the point of connection to a load or to the electricity grid can be made. The cost is typically given per kilowatt-hour or megawatt-hour. It includes the initial capital, discount rate, as well as the costs of continuous operation, fuel, and maintenance.This type of calculation assists policy makers, researchers and others to guide discussions and decision making.hat method arrives at external costs of electricity from lignite at 10.75 Eurocent/kWh, from hard coal 8.94 Eurocent/kWh, from natural gas 4.91 Eurocent/kWh, from photovoltaic 1.18 Eurocent/kWh, from wind 0.26 Eurocent/kWh and from hydro 0.18 Eurocent/kWh.

1692	Confidence votes 18.3K. The frequency and the amplitude are related in such a way that, the greater the amplitude the greater is the energy. The sound pressure amplitude tells about how loud the tone will be and the frequency (cycles per second) of the oscillation tells how high the sound of the tone will be.
1693	Difference Between Amplitude and Frequency. Amplitude and frequency are two of the basic properties of periodic motions. A proper understanding in these concepts is required in the study of motions such as simple harmonic motions and damped harmonic motions.
1694	Wavelength. 1  Frequency tells us how many waves are passing a point per second, the inverse of time. 2  Wavelength tells us the length of those waves in metres, almost like a displacement. 3  If we multiply these two together, we are really multiplying 1/s and mâ¦ which gives us m/s, the velocity of the wave!
1695	In this article, we are going to discuss what frequency and amplitude are, their definitions, the measurement and dependencies of amplitude and frequency, and finally the difference between amplitude and frequency. Frequency. Frequency is a concept discussed in periodic motions of objects.
1696	Amplitude vs Frequency . Amplitude and frequency are two of the basic properties of periodic motions. A proper understanding in these concepts is required in the study of motions such as simple harmonic motions and damped harmonic motions.
1697	What is the difference between amplitude and frequency? â¢ Amplitude strictly depends on the total energy of the system, whereas frequency of an oscillation depends on the properties of the oscillator itself. â¢ For a given system, the amplitude can be changed but frequency cannot.
1698	Amplitude vs Frequency. Amplitude and frequency are two of the basic properties of periodic motions. A proper understanding in these concepts is required in the study of motions such as simple harmonic motions and damped harmonic motions.
1699	Amplitude decides the intensity ie energy content of the wave and frequency is different right from amplitude. If the maximum amplitude,E, i â¦ s known then the instantaneous amplitude, e, can be found by e=E*sin(2*pi*f*t) where f is the frequency and t is the time in seconds from the start of the sine wave.

1701	amplitude is the height of the wave from the middle point, it can be either from the middle to the bottom, or middle to the top of the wave. the frequency is how frequent the â¦ crests of each wave (the amplitude) pass a given point. so how they relate is, the highest point/lowest point is the crest, and the that is the amplitude is the ends of the crests ===== (In other words, to paraphrase the above remarks, there is no relationship between the amplitude and frequency of a wave.
1702	The fundamental purpose of the board is to preside over something called the Doomsday Clock. The symbolic time piece was created in 1947 as a way to highlight the threat of global nuclear war but has since grown to involve some of the worldâs greatest minds â including 15 Nobel Laureates â who meet to examine the urgent challenges facing humanity.
1703	Just what is the Doomsday Clock? 1:18 The Doomsday Clock is a theoretical indicator of how close humanity is to a doomsday event. Started in 1947, the board of scientists who decide what the clock says has included Einstein, Oppenheimer and is now chaired by theoretical physicist Lawrence Krauss.
1704	You can check it at: What is the 'Doomsday Clock'? The Islamic teachings that are found in the Holy Quran or in the words of Hadith of the Prophet Muhammad (SAWS), do address the details of The Day of Judgement.
1705	But i will give you a quotations for a better understanding. Similarly, in 1947 the experts from the Bulletin of the Atomic Scientists magazine of the University of Chicago instituted the so-called âDoomsday Clockâ â a symbolic reference point that has the purpose to show how close the world is to self-destruction.
1706	In 1947, at the start of the Cold War, the clock was set at 23:53, seven minutes before midnight â the symbol for global disaster. Ever since, the clock has been repeatedly readjusted by the directors of the magazine in order to correspond to reality.
1707	The Doomsday Clock: Menacing Metaphor of the Nuclear Age. Pessimism is on the rise. Mercurial politicians, rising nationalism and isolationism, international bluster, a changing climate, mass protests, and many other occurrences are contributing to a generally gloomy mood.
1708	âThe purpose of the Doomsday Clock is to provide a graphical way for people to suddenly think about these existential threats,â Prof Krauss said. âPeople tend to avoid thinking about these existential threats and donât talk about them.â
1709	The Doomsday Clock is a symbolic clock face, representing a countdown to possible global catastrophe (e.g. nuclear war or climate change). It has been maintained since 1947 by the members of the Science and Security Board of the Bulletin of the Atomic Scientists,[1] who are in turn advised by the Governing Board and the Board of Sponsors, including 18 Nobel Laureates.
1710	Originally Answered: What is the doomsday clock? Does it really matter? The members of the Bulletin of the Atomic Scientists created the clock as an analogy to how close the world was/is to destruction.
1711	Reflecting this, the doomsday clock was recently moved to 2 minutes 30 seconds, the closest it has been to doomsday in decades. That sounds ominous, but what is the doomsday clock? The doomsday clock was created by The Bulletin of Atomic Scientists, a journal founded as a response to atomic bombs in Hiroshima and Nagasaki. Most of the founding editors were scientists who helped to develop atomic weapons in the first place. The clock first appeared on the Bulletinâs cover in 1947, and has appeared in the table of contents
1712	Ear infections are less common in adults than in children, but they may be more serious or more difficult to treat. Ear infections are less common in adults than in children, but they may be more serious or more difficult to treat.
1713	One of the reasons children are more likely than adults to get ear infections is that their eustachian tubes are smaller and more horizontal than the tubes in most adults. If you have small eustachian tubes or you have tubes that havenât developed more of a slope, youâre at a higher risk for developing an ear infection.
1714	What is an Ear Infection? Infection can affect the ear canal (otitis externa), the eardrum , or the middle ear (otitis media). Most ear injuries are caused by pressure changes during direct injury (such as a blow to the ear) or sport scuba diving, but, a persistently painful ear may signal an infection that requires treatment.
1715	Chronic ear infection symptoms may be less noticeable than those of acute ear infections. Children younger than 6 months who have a fever or ear infection symptoms should see a doctor. Always seek medical attention if your child has a fever higher than 102Â°F or severe ear pain.
1716	Ear infections are often caused by bacterial infections. But whether you get an outer or middle ear infection depends on how you become infected. Middle ear infection. A middle ear infection often originates from a cold or other respiratory problem. The infection moves to one or both ears through the eustachian tubes.
1717	Seek medical treatment as soon as possible for an examination of the ear if an ear infection is suspected. Seek medical treatment immediately if you experience a sudden loss in hearing in one or both ears (usually occurring over a period of less than 24-48 hours).
1718	Most mild ear infections clear up without intervention. Some of the following methods are effective in relieving the symptoms of a mild ear infection: applying a warm cloth to the affected ear; taking over-the-counter pain medication such as ibuprofen or acetaminophen; using over-the-counter or prescription ear drops to relieve pain
1719	Ear infections may be more common in children than in adults, but grown-ups are still susceptible to these infections. Unlike childhood ear infections, which are often minor and pass quickly, adult ear infections are frequently signs of a more serious health problem.
1720	Symptoms of ear infection include: ear pain, fullness in the ear, hearing loss, ringing in the ear, discharge from the ear, nausea, vomiting, and; vertigo. Symptoms may follow a respiratory infection such as the common cold. Discharge from the ear canal is often caused by the infection known as swimmer's ear (otitis externa). A painful ear with decreased hearing is often the result of otitis media, an middle ear infection.
1721	An ear infection occurs when a bacterial or viral infection affects the middle ear â the sections of your ear just behind the eardrum. Ear infections can be painful because of inflammation and fluid build-up in the middle ear. Ear infections can be chronic or acute. Acute ear infections are painful but short in duration. Chronic ear infections either do not clear up, or they recur many times. Chronic ear infections can cause permanent damage to the middle and inner ear.
1722	Fields of Anthropology. There are now four major fields of anthropology: biological anthropology, cultural anthropology, linguistic anthropology, and archaeology. Each focuses on a different set of research interests and generally uses different research techniques.
1723	In the first topic room, entitled Scientific Underpinnings, you will meet biological anthropologists, learn how evolution serves as a backbone of their studies, and discover how these scientists go about the business of testing a hypothesis in the first place.
1724	A PROCESS of Observation and Deduction... Observation - gatherinâ¦. Evidence supporting and not supporting a theory. - When a hypothesis has been tested and retested over many yeaâ¦. - An intellectual framework that is the result of testing a thâ¦.
1725	Biological Anthropology. Biological (or physical) anthropologists carry out systematic studies of the non-cultural aspects of humans and near-humans. Non-cultural refers to all of those biological characteristics that are genetically inherited in contrast to learned.
1726	Biological Anthropology. The graduate program in biological anthropology at CU Boulder offers training in several areas, including primatology, human biology, and paleoanthropology. We share an interest in human ecology, the broad integrative area of anthropology that focuses on the interactions of culture, biology and the environment.
1727	Where do we come from? Where are we going? These are some of the big questions biological anthropology seeks to answer, using the principles of evolution as a backdrop for formulating and testing hypotheses about humanity's past, present, and future.

Human beings use culture to adapt to and to transform the world in which they live in. -culture makes us unique. (an e.g of this is that humans need to learn how to survive--> focus in childhood stages)
1729	Graduate Study in Anthropology. The graduate program in biological anthropology at CU Boulder offers training in several areas, including primatology, human biology, and paleoanthropology. We share an interest in human ecology, the broad integrative area of anthropology that focuses on the interactions of culture, biology and the environment.
1730	Anthropology is the study of various aspects of humans within past and present societies. Social anthropology and cultural anthropology study the norms and values of societies. Linguistic anthropology studies how language affects social life. Biological or physical anthropology studies the biological development of humans.
1731	Biological Anthropology. 1  Biological Anthropology is the study of the evolution and ecology of humans and other primates, grounded in an understanding of evolutionary history and extending to applied subjects such as conservation and human development. The UCL Biological Anthropology section is one of the largest groups of academics in Europe that focuses on these subjects.
1732	Making the world better, one answer at a time. The first President of the United States to live in the White House was John Adams, with his wife Abigail Adams. President Washington laid the cornerstone, but it wasn't finished until the final years of Adams's term. President Jefferson was the first to fully live in the building during his entire presidency.
1733	President John Adams and his wife, Abigail, moved into the White House in 1800, shortly before it was completed. Construction began in 1792.
1734	President Harry S. Truman began a renovation of the building in which everything but the outer walls were dismantled. The reconstruction was overseen by architect Lorenzo Winslow, and the Truman family moved back into the White House in 1952.
1735	There are five living former First Ladies: Rosalynn Carter, wife of Jimmy Carter; Nancy Reagan, widow of Ronald Reagan; Barbara Bush, wife of George H. W. Bush; Hillary Clinton, wife of Bill Clinton; and Laura Bush, wife of George W. Bush. The first First Lady was Martha Washington, married to George Washington.
1736	The Office of the First Lady is also in charge of all social and ceremonial events of the White House, and is a branch of the Executive Office of the President. According to the White House and the National First Ladies' Library, there have been forty-five First Ladies and forty-six First Ladyships.

1738	One woman who was not married to a President but who is still considered an official First Lady: Harriet Lane, niece of bachelor James Buchanan. The other non-spousal relatives who served as White House hostesses are not recognized by the First Ladies' Library.
1739	The White House was under construction while President George Washington served in office, and because of this he never used it as his residence. President John Adams and his wife Abigail were the first residents when they moved in November 1800, although the White House was still undergoing some final renovations.
1740	Our first president, George Washington, selected the site for the White House in 1791. The cornerstone was laid in 1792 and a competition design submitted by Irish-born architect James Hoban was chosen. After eight years of construction, President John Adams and his wife, Abigail, moved into the unfinished house in 1800.

Software that fits the Free Software Definition may be more appropriately called free software; the GNU project in particular objects to their works being referred to as open-source. For more information about the philosophical background for open-source software, see free software movement and Open Source Initiative. However, nearly all software meeting the Free Software Definition also meets the Open Source Definition and vice versa. A small fraction of the software that meets either definition is listed here. Some of the open-source applications are also the basis of commercial products, shown in the List of commercial open-source applications and services.

Home : Software Terms : Open Source Definition. Open Source. When a software program is open source, it means the program's source code is freely available to the public. Unlike commercial software, open source programs can be modified and distributed by anyone and are often developed as a community rather than by a single organization.
Conclusion Although open source software is often free to download and use, open source licenses rarely transfer any ownership of the software to the end user or developer. Open source is not limited to software. Open source philosophies have been applied to everything from medicine to soft drink formulas.

Open source technology is defined as a developmental and production philosophy that allows end users and developers an opportunity to view and edit the source code of software governed by an open source license. Unfortunately, many users confuse open source to mean free. Learn a definition for open source software and explore the differences between free and open source. Learn what open source is and how it relates to software such the Linux operating system.
The FSF considers free software to be a subset of open source software, and Richard Stallman explained that DRM software, for example, can be developed as open source, despite that it does not give its users freedom (it restricts them), and thus doesn't qualify as free software. Open-source software licensing
The open-source model is a decentralized software-development model that encourages open collaboration. A main principle of open-source software development is peer production, with products such as source code, blueprints, and documentation freely available to the public. The open-source movement in software began as a response to the limitations of proprietary code. The model is used for projects such as in open-source appropriate technology, and open-source drug discovery. Open source promote

Generally, Open Source software is software that can be freely accessed, used, changed, and shared (in modified or unmodified form) by anyone. Open source software is made by many people, and distributed under licenses that comply with the The Open Source Definition.
Open source is a kind of free software. It is different from other software because the source code is available to everyone. The source code is a set of instructions for the computer, written in a programming language. Anyone can see how the source code works and can change it if they want to make it work differently. The opposite of open source is closed source. Closed source software is not available to everyone. Open source has a lot in common with free software but each has its own focus and goals. Open source and free software have been around for decades.
Open Source. When a software program is open source, it means the program's source code is freely available to the public. Unlike commercial software, open source programs can be modified and distributed by anyone and are often developed as a community rather than by a single organization. For this reason, the phrase open source community is commonly used to describe the developer of open source software development projects. Since the source code of an open source program can be modified by anyone, it makes sense that the software is also free to download and use. The terms of use are often defined by the GNU General Public License, which serves as the software license agreement (SLA) for many open source programs.

Free software is not the same as freeware, software available at zero price. The definition of open source software was written to be almost identical to the free software definition. There are very few cases of software that is open source software but is not free software.
What is open source software? Open source software is software with source code that anyone can inspect, modify, and enhance. Source code is the part of software that most computer users don't ever see; it's the code computer programmers can manipulate to change how a piece of softwareâa program or applicationâworks.
Open Storage: As a general term, open storage refers to storage systems built with an open architecture using industry-standard hardware and open-source software. This might be obvious to some, but lets break this down just a little. Open Source-Using Open Source software is a key differentiator. Most storage vendors use proprietary software for their storage systems. Some might argue that using Open Source is more prone to vulnerabilities since the code is easily available.
One popular set of open-source software licenses are those approved by the Open Source Initiative (OSI) based on their Open Source Definition (OSD).
What is open source beyond software? At Opensource.com, we like to say that we're interested in the ways open source values and principles apply to the world beyond software. We like to think of open source as not only a way to develop and license computer software, but also an attitude.
Open-source software (OSS) is computer software with its source code made available with a license in which the copyright holder provides the rights to study, change, and distribute the software to anyone and for any purpose. Open-source software may be developed in a collaborative public manner.
The basics behind the Open Source Initiative is that when programmers can read, redistribute and modify the source code for a piece of software, the software evolves. Open source sprouted in the technological community as a response to proprietary software owned by corporations.
OSS ILS refers to Open Source Software Integrated Library Systems. The open source software movement is based on the belief that users should have access to the source code of the software they use. Users are generally free to use, modify, and redistribute the software back to the community.

Take from http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Open-source_software. Open source software (OSS) began as a marketing campaign for free software. OSS can be defined as computer software for which the human-readable source code is made available under a copyright license (or arrangement such as the public domain) that meets the Open Source Definition.
There are a lot of options for developing for open source or with open source tools (as are there with proprietary development). The biggest difference between open source and proprietary is the access you have to the software code. Within the world of FOSS (free open source software) the code is readily available.
From Free Open Source Software. Free Open Source Software (FOSS), also called just Open Source or Free Software, is licensed to be free to use, modify, and distribute. Most FOSS licenses also include a kind of legal Golden Rule, requiring any changes - such as fixes and enhancements - be released under the same license.
The Open Source Definition, notably, presents an open-source philosophy, and further defines the terms of usage, modification and redistribution of open-source software. Software licenses grant rights to users which would otherwise be reserved by copyright law to the copyright holder.

Open-source software also allows developers to âstand on the shoulders of giantsâ and create their own software. Witness Android and Chrome OS, which are operating systems built on Linux and other open-source software. The core of Appleâs OS X â and therefor iOS â was built on open-source code, too.
OPEN SOURCE. Open Source Software has a special meaning for Walt Disney Animation Studios (WDAS). Allowing Open Source Software to become a common foundation for many technologies, WDAS has championed the use of and now contributes to such software. In short, we want to contribute back to the community; therefore, we have established this platform.
The term open source refers to something that can be modified and shared because its design is publicly accessible. While it originated in the context of computer software development, today the term open source designates a set of valuesâwhat we call the open source way.n order to use proprietary software, computer users must agree (usually by signing a license displayed the first time they run this software) that they will not do anything with the software that the software's authors have not expressly permitted. Open source software is different.

Note: In February 1998 a group moved to replace the term Free Software with Open Source Software. This terminology debate reflects underlying philosophical differences, but the practical requirements placed on software licenses, and the discussion in the rest of this page, are essentially the same for both Free Software and Open Source Software.
While less common than commercial proprietary software, free and open-source software may also be commercial software in the free and open-source software (FOSS) domain. But unlike the proprietary model, commercialization is achieved in the FOSS commercialization model without limiting the users in their capability to share, reuse and duplicate software freely.
As they do with proprietary software, users must accept the terms of a license when they use open source softwareâbut the legal terms of open source licenses differ dramatically from those of proprietary licenses. Open source licenses affect the way people can use, study, modify, and distribute software.

Most sources of electrical energy (the mains, a battery) are modeled as voltage sources. An ideal voltage source provides no energy when it is loaded by an open circuit (i.e. an infinite impedance), but approaches infinite energy and current when the load resistance approaches zero (a short circuit).onversely, a current source provides a constant current, as long as the load connected to the source terminals has sufficiently low impedance. An ideal current source would provide no energy to a short circuit and approach infinite energy and voltage as the load resistance approaches infinity (an open circuit).

The contraction of the ventricular muscle raises the pressure in the ventricle. The high pressure in the ventricle forces the bicuspid valve to close and forces blood up the aorta. The diagram shows that the semi-lunar valves are pushed open. During diastole the thick muscular walls of the ventricles relax. The pressure of the blood in the ventricles falls low enough for the bicuspid valve to open. At the same time, the atrium contracts. Blood is forced from the atrium into the ventricle. This blows the ventricle up like a balloon. Source(s): .
